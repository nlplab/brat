Title: Structured labeling for facilitating concept evolution in machine learning

Abstract: Labeling data is a seemingly simple task required for training many machine learning systems, but is actually fraught with problems. This paper introduces the notion of <i>concept evolution</i>, the changing nature of a person's underlying <i>concept</i> (the abstract notion of the target class a person is labeling for, e.g., <i>spam</i> email, <i>travel related</i> web pages) which can result in inconsistent labels and thus be detrimental to machine learning. We introduce two <i>structured labeling</i> solutions, a novel technique we propose for helping people define and refine their concept in a consistent manner as they label. Through a series of five experiments, including a controlled lab study, we illustrate the impact and dynamics of concept evolution in practice and show that structured labeling helps people label more consistently in the presence of concept evolution than traditional labeling.

ABSTRACT Labeling data is a seemingly simple task required for training many machine learning systems, 
but is actually fraught with problems. This paper introduces the notion of concept evolution, the changing 
nature of a person s underlying concept (the abstract notion of the target class a person is labeling 
for, e.g., spam email, travel related web pages) which can result in inconsistent labels and thus be 
detrimental to machine learning. We introduce two structured labeling solutions, a novel technique we 
propose for helping people define and refine their concept in a consistent manner as they label. Through 
a series of five experiments, including a controlled lab study, we illustrate the impact and dynamics 
of concept evolution in practice and show that structured labeling helps people label more consistently 
in the presence of concept evolution than traditional labeling. Author Keywords Concept evolution; interactive

is trained from example data that is labeled according to some target concept. The result is a learned 
function that can predict the labels of new, unseen data. The performance of machine learning depends 
on the quality of the labeled data used for training. For example, spam filters are often machine-learned 
functions that are trained from a large corpus of emails or web pages labeled as spam or not spam. Poorly 
performing spam filters may admit unwanted spam or, worse yet, incorrectly classify important email or 
web pages as spam. Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal

often recruit people to label the large amounts of data machine learners need to support automated services 
such as ranking web search results (e.g., [16, 20]), providing recommendations (e.g., [31]), or displaying 
relevant ads (e.g., [34]). Additionally, interactive machine learning systems allow individual end-users 
to label data to improve personalized services such as email filtering and prioritization (e.g., [12, 
13]), and music or movie recommendations (e.g., [35]). While labeling data is a seemingly simple task, 
it is actually fraught with problems (e.g., [9, 19, 26]). Labels reflect a labeler s mapping between 
the data and their underlying concept (i.e., their abstract notion of the target class). Thus, label 
quality is affected by factors such as the labeler s expertise or familiarity with the concept or data, 
their judgment ability and attentiveness during labeling, and the ambiguity and changing distribution 
of the data itself. This paper addresses a distinct problem in labeling data that we refer to as concept 
evolution. Concept evolution refers to the labeler s process of defining and refining a concept in their 
minds, and can result in different labels being applied to similar items due to changes in the labeler 
s notion of the underlying concept. In a formative study presented later in this paper, we found that 
people labeling a set of web pages twice with a four-week gap between labeling sessions were, on average, 
only 81% consistent with their initial labels. This inconsistency in labeling similar items can be harmful 
to machine learning, which is fundamentally based on the idea that similar inputs should have similar 
outputs [18]. Further, while label quality is always important in machine learning, quality is especially 
critical in situations where data quantity is limited (e.g., when labels are expensive to obtain or when 
individuals are labeling data for their own purposes, as in many interactive machine learning systems) 
[1]. To address the concept evolution problem, we introduce structured labeling (Figure 1), a novel interaction 
technique for helping people define and refine their concepts as they label data. Structured labeling 
allows people to organize their concept definition by grouping and tagging data (as much or as little 
as they choose) within a traditional labeling scheme (e.g., labeling into mutually exclusive categories 
such as yes , no , and could be ). This organization capability helps to increase label consistency by 
helping people  Figure 1. Our structured labeling approach allows people to group data in whatever 
way makes sense to them. By seeing the resulting structure, people can gain a deeper understanding of 
the concept they are modeling. Here, the user sees an uncategorized page (top left) and can drag it to 
an existing group (right), or create a new group for it. The thumbnails (bottom left) show similar pages 
in the dataset to help the user gauge whether creating a new group is warranted. explicitly surface and 
recall labeling decisions. Further, because the structure is malleable (users can create, delete, split, 
and merge groups), it is well-suited for situations where users are likely to frequently refine their 
concept definition as they observe new data. We also present an assisted structured labeling version 
of our tool that uses visual aids and label recommendations to further assist people labeling data while 
their concept evolves. This paper makes the following contributions: . We introduce the concept evolution 
problem and present findings from three formative studies illustrating the impact and dynamics of concept 
evolution in situations where people interact with machine learning. . We introduce two tools for structured 
labeling, a novel interaction technique for helping people evolve their concepts during labeling. . We 
present a controlled experiment comparing our structured labeling tools to traditional labeling in machine 
learning. Our findings show that structured labeling was preferred by participants and helped them label 
data more consistently, but at a cost of speed. . We present findings from a small follow up experiment 
showing that structured labeling helps people arrive at more consistent structuring decisions than traditional 
labeling when labeling the same data ten days apart.  BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK In this section we 
describe how concept evolution differs from other labeling problems in machine learning and why existing 
solutions to these problems therefore do not address concept evolution. We then describe related work 
in sensemaking and information management that inspired our structured labeling approach to concept evolution 
and explain how our work extends research in this area to the problem of labeling in machine learning. 
 Labeling Challenges and Solutions in Machine Learning Supervised machine learning requires labeled data 
for training a machine learner [18]. However, there are many well-studied challenges that arise from 
obtaining humanÂ­labeled data. For example, labels can be noisy, meaning some data may be mislabeled or 
labels may be applied inconsistently. As a result, the machine learning community has developed noise-tolerant 
algorithms (e.g., [10, 30) and techniques for automatically identifying and eliminating or correcting 
mislabeled data (e.g., [9]). While algorithmic solutions can reduce the impact of label noise on the 
quality of the resulting machine learners, they do not help users refine a target concept in their own 
minds. More recently, researchers have started to explore novel interfaces to reduce label noise. For 
example, Carterette et al. [11] showed that pairwise comparisons (e.g., is document A better than document 
B) produced more reliable relevance labels than absolute judgments. Set-wise judgments have also been 
explored for obtaining relevance labels (e.g., [4]). While comparison-based judgments have been shown 
to be easier to make than absolute judgments, relevance judgments may still evolve as people observe 
data [7]. Thus, techniques for soliciting labels via comparisons can still benefit from support for structuring 
and revisiting labeling decisions. Another common approach to dealing with label noise is to use multiple 
labelers and majority voting or weighting schemes to make final label judgments (e.g., [19, 26]). Again, 
while techniques involving multiple labelers might help reduce label noise, they do not solve the concept 
evolution problem. In contrast, our structured labeling approach may benefit these multiple labeler solutions 
by enabling people to share their labeling decisions and potentially even converge on a target concept 
definition.  Furthermore, a growing class of interactive machine learning systems rely on labeled data 
from individual users [1] and therefore cannot benefit from multiple labeler solutions. Because the amount 
of data individuals may be willing or able to label can be much less than in multiple labeler solutions, 
even a few mislabeled items can be a substantial portion of the data and be detrimental to learning [8]. 
An even more insidious problem in data labeling is concept drift, where the underlying data is fundamentally 
changing over time [29]. An example of concept drift is a news recommender that attempts to recommend 
the most interesting recent news. Here, the concept of interesting may remain the same over time, but 
the data (in this case the news) is constantly drifting as a result of changing current events. Most 
solutions to concept drift model concepts temporally, such as by discarding or weighting information 
according to a moving window over the data (e.g., [27, 33) or by automatically identifying new types 
of data (e.g., [5, 15]). Critically, none of these solutions are intended to help a user refine their 
own idea of a concept, a problem which may be exacerbated in the presence of concept drift.  Tools for 
Sensemaking and Data Management Our proposed structured labeling solution to the concept evolution problem 
is inspired by work in sensemaking [23], the iterative process of organizing and understanding large 
amounts of data. Our work is particularly related to sensemaking research for information and document 
management (e.g., [3, 14, 21, 24]). As with structured labeling, these tools often leverage spatial memory 
and visual representations to help people organize information [32]. For example, Data Mountain facilitates 
sensemaking and information management by enabling users to arrange documents in a 3D virtual environment 
[24]. Teevan et al. [28] explored several visual representations of information to aid people in finding 
and re-finding information. Others have explored techniques for visualizing groups of documents, such 
as fanning out or stacking document thumbnails and displaying textual summaries (e.g., [3, 24]). Our 
assisted structured labeling tool, which employs automated visual cues and recommendations, is closely 
related to recent work on tools for semi-automated support of sensemaking and information management 
(e.g., [2, 3]. For example, iCluster [3] helps people sort documents into spatially organized groups 
or piles by making group recommendations for incoming documents via highlighting. Similarly, CueT [2] 
helps people triage network alarms (described by short snippets of information), into existing alarm 
groups by making group recommendations via a 1 http://www.dmoz.org/ ranked list and accompanying confidence 
visualization. All of these tools support sensemaking to facilitate personal or collaborative information 
consumption and management such as browsing and navigating, searching and re-finding, and sharing or 
distributing information. In contrast, our work on structured labeling extends sensemaking to the domain 
of document labeling for machine learning and demonstrates the impact of such supports on the quality 
of human provided labels. In addition, as our studies reveal, sensemaking for the labeling task presents 
unique information management problems that require novel solutions such as helping users determine if 
and how to organize individual documents and how to make labeling decisions.  CONCEPT EVOLUTION IN PRACTICE 
To better understand concept evolution and inform the design of our proposed solution, we conducted a 
series of formative studies investigating concept evolution in practice (i.e., in situations involving 
people labeling data for machine learning systems). Observations and feedback from these studies informed 
our final prototypes, as discussed in the Structured Labeling and Assistance section. Concept Evolution 
during Interactive Machine Learning Even experienced machine learning practitioners evolve their concepts 
while labeling. We asked 11 machine learning experts from a large research organization to train binary 
web page classifiers via an interactive machine learning system. Each expert labeled data according to 
a concept of their choice, selected from a list of Open Directory Project1 topics (e.g., photography, 
employment, and math). From a questionnaire distributed after the session, we found that nine of the 
participants defined/refined their concept while interacting with the tool. This concept evolution could 
be the result of viewing additional data (only three people disagreed that their concept evolved as a 
result of seeing web pages ) or of using other features offered by the tool (e.g., viewing errors or 
experimenting with different feature combinations). This suggests that multiple factors may trigger concept 
evolution. Interestingly, seven participants also stated I had a clear idea about the concept I was modeling 
before starting . However, four of these seven also agreed or were neutral about the statement the concept 
I was modeling evolved as I saw web pages , suggesting that even when people are familiar with a concept, 
their definition of it may still evolve.  Concept Evolution during Creation of Label Guidelines When 
acquiring labeled data for the purpose of training or testing machine learning, researchers and practitioners 
often create guidelines for labelers in order to obtain consistent labels (e.g., [16, 20]), where consistent 
is defined as similar items having the same label. We interviewed two practitioners from a large organization 
with extensive experience creating such guidelines for human labelers. Both practitioners described the 
typical guideline creation process as iterative and evolving as a result of observing new data.  According 
to our interviews, a team of people would first look through example data potentially matching their 
target concept. Next, the team would discuss how different examples should be labeled and come up with 
rules to explain their decision making. These rules often targeted difficult cases (e.g., examples with 
multiple interpretations), explicitly stating how such cases should be labeled and giving concrete examples. 
Often there would be several rounds of this process until a relatively comprehensive set of rules were 
generated and could be passed off to labelers. Impact of Concept Evolution on Label Consistency and Initial 
Feedback on Structured Labeling We conducted a preliminary study using an early prototype of our structured 
labeling tool to examine the impact of concept evolution and obtain feedback about how the tool could 
be improved. This prototype displayed one web page at a time and asked participants to categorize the 
page into one of three high-level categories: yes , no , or could be (i.e., this is, is not, or could 
be an example of concept X). In addition, participants could create groups within the could be category 
and tag them to remind themselves of what they had put in the group. (Throughout this paper, category 
refers to the high-level labels yes , no , and could be , while group refers to a user-created collection 
of items within a category. A tag is a user-supplied group description.) We asked nine of the participants 
from our first study to label ~200 web pages using our prototype and according to the same concept they 
chose for the previous study. For each participant, 75% of the pages were the same pages they had labeled 
during the first study (displayed in a different order). This study occurred about four weeks after the 
first study. Examining the consistency of participants high-level labels (i.e., the yes , no and could 
be categories) from the first study to the second revealed that, on average, participants were only 81.7% 
(SD=6.8%) consistent with their previous labels (Figure 2). McNemar-Bowker tests of symmetry also showed 
that six of the nine participants labels changed significantly (.2 (3,N=156)=9.51-30.37, p<.05) from 
the first study. This lack of consistency means models learned from these labels will be different, even 
for the same person s definition of the same concept their concept definition significantly evolved between 
the two labeling sessions. In addition to finding evidence of concept evolution, this 100% study revealed 
some of the benefits of structured labeling. First, all nine participants created groups (median of six 
groups per participant with three pages per group). We manually annotated each of the groups and determined 
that most groups (~76%) were topical in nature (e.g., computing related or mathematicians groups for 
the math concept). The rest pertained to items people wanted to revisit for different reasons, essentially 
deferring decisions until they had a better understanding of the data (e.g., mixed content , more info 
needed ). This visible organization proved popular in one participant s own words: [Categorization] allows 
me to organize my thoughts. Further, participants felt that seeing the structure made labeling less stressful 
because they could easily see and revise their labels as needed: I like the structuring. It s like a 
softer way of labeling.  STRUCTURED LABELING AND ASSISTANCE In this section, we describe our structured 
labeling and assisted structured labeling prototypes and relate our design decisions back to findings 
from our formative studies. Structured Labeling Prototype Our structured labeling prototype (Figure 
1) allows users to organize data within a traditional labeling scheme (e.g., mutually exclusive categories 
such as yes , no , and could be ) via grouping and tagging. The system presents users with one page at 
a time, which they can drag to the labeling area (right in Figure 1) to create a new group or to add 
it an existing group. Users can manually add tags describing each group to aid in recall (e.g., Tours 
in Figure 3). In our formative study with an early version of our structured labeling prototype, we only 
allowed users to structure within the could be category we believed users would only want to structure 
ambiguous items. However, several of our participants requested structuring within the yes and no categories 
as well, citing a desire to preserve and revisit groups so they could later decide whether each group 
was part of their concept or not (i.e., moving groups between the could be and yes or no categories): 
It s nice not to lose information in a big pile [of yes or no pages]. Another reason users desired structuring 
within the yes and no categories was to make their labeling decisions visible to others: Comics that 
became movies is ambiguous, [but] you can imagine someone [else] would be interested. Based on this feedback, 
we altered our prototype to support structuring in all categories. We also enabled structure editing 
via moving groups between categories (preserving any accompanying tags), merging groups, or moving individual 
items between groups. In addition, while we enabled structuring in all categories, we wanted to encourage 
Figure 2. Label consistency (per participant) on the same data users to focus on structuring only items 
they wished to revisit  labeled approximately four weeks apart. (and not items they felt clearly belonged 
to their concept or Dark bars indicate significant differences. not); thus, we created default Definitely 
yes and Definitely  no groups within the yes and no categories (Figure 1).  Assisted Structuring During 
our formative study we observed participants encountering obstacles with some structuring capabilities. 
Here we describe additional supports we designed to help users overcome these obstacles. These supports 
are included as part of our assisted structured labeling tool. Helping Users Recall Group Contents Participants 
often had trouble remembering what they had placed in each group. While they could tag each group with 
a textual description, many participants did not initially make use of this feature and later regretted 
not taking the time to tag groups. As one participant phrased it: Now that I want to insert [another 
item] I wish I had a title. To help users recall group contents, we augmented our structured labeling 
tool to automatically generate and display textual summaries for each group (Figure 3). Users could still 
manually supply tags in addition to these summaries. We experimented with two bag-of-words approaches 
for creating textual summaries. Initially, we considered the content of web pages within each group as 
a bag-of-words (i.e., the set of words from all the pages within a group), and selected the most frequently 
occurring words from the bag, with frequency computed via the common term frequencyÂ­inverse document 
frequency (TF-IDF) measure [22]. However, we found that the resulting words were difficult to interpret 
out of context. We then turned to a corpus of search query information from a popular search engine. 
Thus, each web page was represented by a set of search query phrases that actual people used to find 
that web page via the search engine. Because such phrases are typically short and targeted, we believed 
they might generate clearer summaries. Therefore, we took the same approach of considering each group 
of web pages as a bag-of-words, this time made up of search query phrases, and selected the words with 
the highest TF-IDFs to display as our summaries. Intuitively, the summaries displayed the most prominent 
search terms used to find the web pages within each group. These summaries were updated in real-time 
as group contents changed. Helping Users Decide Where to Group Items During our formative study, we observed 
people having trouble deciding which group to put items in when they had several groups with related 
content: Figure 3 Our assisted structuring tool provides users with automatic summaries of each group 
s contents (below the user-supplied tag area) and recommends a group for the current item via an animation 
and yellow star indicator. The black squares indicate how many items are in each group. I remember seeing 
a page like this, but I can t remember which decision I made. To help people decide which group might 
be most appropriate for each new item, we added group recommendations to our structured labeling tool. 
Recommendations were made by computing the similarity between a new item and each group, with the most 
similar group recommended. We computed item-to-group similarity as the similarity between the new item 
and the most similar item in the group (i.e., we computed similarity between the new item and all members 
of a group and then selected the shortest-link as the similarity value). We computed itemÂ­to-item similarity 
via the common cosine similarity metric over a TF-IDF representation of the contents of each item. Group 
recommendations were shown in the interface using a wiggle animation on the group to draw the user s 
attention and a static indicator visible within the recommended group (the star icon in Figure 3). Helping 
Users Determine When and How to Make Decisions In our formative study, we observed that participants 
did not want to expend effort labeling or grouping outliers : If there are more than one or a few [pages] 
with that same property then I ll think about it, otherwise I won t. Other participants said that seeing 
multiple related items helped them decide how items should be labeled: Once you see a lot in a group, 
it helps you decide To help people determine if an item is an outlier or one of many similar items, we 
included a display of the most similar unlabeled pages to the item currently being labeled (the small 
thumbnails displayed horizontally at the bottom of Figure 1). Similar items were identified using the 
same item-to-item similarity measure used to make group recommendations.  EVALUATING STRUCTURED LABELING 
Our structured labeling tools are intended to help people consistently define and refine their concepts 
as they observe data. Therefore, we designed a controlled experiment to compare structured labeling to 
traditional labeling in machine learning in terms of label quality, speed, and use and preference for 
structuring to help define concepts. Conditions and Tasks Our experiment tested three interface conditions: 
a manual structuring condition with support for structured labeling (but without any automated assistance), 
an assisted structuring condition with structuring support plus automated assistance, and a baseline 
condition representing traditional labeling into mutually exclusive yes , no , and could be categories 
and with no structuring support (i.e., the manual interface without the ability to create groups). In 
order to compare subjective preferences for these three labeling techniques, we intended for every participant 
to use each interface. Consequently, we needed to develop three comparable but different labeling tasks. 
This is nonÂ­trivial due to the variety of factors affecting labeling and structuring decisions (e.g., 
concept familiarity, the inherent structure present in the data). Therefore, we prioritized the following 
requirements affecting our primary objectives:  . All participants should be reasonably familiar with 
the target concept for each task. This was to reduce any frustrations and delays that might be caused 
by lack of familiarity with a concept during labeling (e.g., a person unfamiliar with equestrianism might 
become frustrated trying to label items as related to equestrianism or not). . Each task should contain 
the same number of items to label and roughly the same proportion of items likely belonging, not belonging, 
and possibly belonging to the target concept (i.e., items likely to be labeled yes , no , and could be 
, respectively). This was to reduce any effects of label class on labeling speed, as our formative studies 
showed that clearly positive and negative items were typically easier and faster to label than ambiguous 
items. We aimed for a 30/30/40 percent split in the likely label of the items ( yes , no , and could 
be , respectively), allowing for more could be items as we expected to see more structuring within this 
class. . Each task should contain roughly an equivalent amount of structure in the ambiguous class. This 
was to reduce the effects of differences in the amount of structure on labeling speed and decision making. 
Again, this was prompted by our formative study; some participants commented that having too many groups 
required too many decisions. We focused on structure similarity in the could be class because we expected 
more structuring and more difficult structuring decisions over ambiguous items. . Each task should contain 
roughly the same number of pairs of items that could reasonably be construed as belonging together. Examining 
pairs of items that should belong together (i.e., should have the same label) is our intended mechanism 
for measuring label quality. An alternative would be to compare the performance of machine learned models 
built with the labeled data produced by each participant. However, such models are affected by many factors 
(e.g., concept complexity, feature quality); thus, differences in model performance cannot be entirely 
attributed to label quality. This is particularly true for small datasets, where a large amount of variance 
is expected [8]. Therefore, because supervised machine learning is based on the premise that similar 
inputs should have similar outputs [18], label consistency of pairs of similar items is a reasonable 
proxy for label quality. To create these tasks, we again turned to the Open Directory Project. First, 
we selected candidate concepts meeting our familiarity requirement (e.g., concepts related to everyday 
activities, such as cooking related web pages). Then, two of our experimenters independently coded approximately 
160 web pages for each candidate concept. These web pages were selected from a corpus of about 180,000 
pages in the Open Directory Project database. Approximately half of the pages coded were listed as part 
of the concept in the database and half were taken randomly from the rest of the corpus. The coders applied 
three high-level codes to the web pages ( yes , no , and could be ) and also created their own groups 
of could be pages. We then selected web pages that both coders agreed upon, based on the intuition that 
while people might differ in their labeling decisions on some data, they also might agree on some decisions 
(e.g., people might disagree about whether a web page about catering services matches the concept of 
cooking, but many people would likely agree that a page containing recipes is about cooking). Selecting 
items that two people agreed upon therefore helps ensure that the tasks contain data meeting our specified 
requirements (e.g., having similar proportions of yes , no and could be , as well as similar amounts 
of structure). Throughout this process, we eliminated candidate datasets along the way that broke any 
of our requirements. Our final set of tasks pertained to the concepts of cooking, travel, and gardening. 
We obtained 54 manually coded items for each task with 16/16/22 items within the yes , no , and could 
be categories, respectively. Each data set also contained six to seven groups within the could be category 
that both coders agreed upon. We then supplemented this data set with 54 additional items selected by 
taking the nearest neighbor of each manually coded item (based on cosine similarity over a bag-of-words 
representation) within our corpus of Open Directory Project pages. Each of our final tasks therefore 
contained 108 items to label. Note that for our analyses discussed later in this paper, we use all of 
the data (both the manually coded and supplemental data) to measure labeling speed but use only the manually 
coded data to measure label consistency in order to ensure that items we considered as pairs should indeed 
belong together.  Participants and Procedure Fifteen participants were recruited from a large software 
company for this experiment (six female) ranging in age from 22 to 45 years old. All participants reported 
computer use of at least 30-40 hours per week (median of 40-50 hours). No participant had a background 
in machine learning, and only one worked as a software developer (the rest were program managers or worked 
in non-development departments, such as marketing and legal). We used a within-subjects study design, 
counterbalancing interface order with a Latin-square. Because we did not expect concepts to have carryover 
effects between tasks, we fixed task order to cooking, travel, and then gardening. Before each task, 
participants were given a brief introduction to the interface they would use for that task and time to 
practice with it. We used the same concept libraries for the practice tasks. For each actual task, we 
asked participants to categorize the web pages in term of whether you think they are about [cooking/gardening/travel] 
or not , according to their own definition of the target concept. All interactions with each interface 
were logged. After completing each task, participants filled out a questionnaire gauging their attitudes 
toward the interface they used for that task. After completing all three tasks, a final questionnaire 
was distributed asking participants about their overall preferences for the different interfaces.  
 RESULTS Our analyses of the data we collected from our experiment fall into four general categories: 
tool usage, label quality, labeling speed, and user attitudes and preferences. Unless otherwise noted, 
we computed quantitative comparisons using the Friedman rank sum test followed by post-hoc Wilcoxon rank 
sum tests with Bonferroni correction. Usage of Structured Labeling Supports Having the ability to structure 
data does not imply people will actually do so. Because we did not request or require that participants 
use the structuring supports, we were able to investigate whether their own sense of the usefulness of 
structuring would outweigh the time and mental effort cost of structuring (according to Attention Investment 
Theory [6], people will not invest attention in activities unless they think the benefits will outweigh 
the costs). If participants did not feel structured labeling was useful, we would expect to see no differences 
between the numbers of groups (i.e., structurings) across the three conditions. However, we found that 
participants did indeed make use of structuring supports (Figure 4, left), finishing the study with significantly 
more groups with the structured labeling conditions than with the baseline (X2=20.19, df=2, p<.001). 
Pairwise tests confirmed that both manual (p<.001) and assisted (p<.001) structured labeling resulted 
in more groups than our baseline (which had three permanent groups). This suggests that participants 
felt the benefits of structuring their labels outweighed the costs of doing so. As expected, participants 
most often structured pages within the could be category. Some participants also structured in the yes 
category, but very few structured the no category. This was likely because the no category contained 
a wider variety of unrelated pages, making structuring seem less useful or more time consuming. Figure 
4 (right) also shows that the could be groups were often smaller than yes groups, which in turn were 
often smaller than no groups. Usage of our structured labeling prototypes also revealed evidence of concept 
evolution. Participants revised their structuring (i.e., moved pages between groups or groups between 
categories) significantly more often while using the 5 60 4 403 2 20 1 0 0 Baseline Manual Assisted

structured labeling conditions than the baseline during the first half of each labeling session (X2=8.93, 
df=2, p=.011), with pairwise tests showing more revisions in both manual (p=.006) and assisted (p=.024) 
compared to the baseline. Interestingly, differences were also observed during the second half of each 
labeling session (X2=8.04, df=2, p=.018), however, only the manual condition showed more revisions than 
baseline during this period (p=.012). These results suggest that structured labeling encouraged concept 
evolution and the assisted structured supports may have enabled people to solidify their concept definition 
sooner than with manual structuring alone. Figure 5 (right) shows another discrepancy between manual 
and assisted structuring participants revisited many more pages using the manual condition than the assisted 
condition. This was especially pronounced during the second half of the labeling sessions (X2=12, df=2, 
p=.002), and pairwise tests confirm that manual significantly differed from baseline (p=.005) and assisted 
(p=.005) during this time. Again, this discrepancy may be attributable to the assisted structuring supports 
for recalling group content via summaries (reducing the need to manually review a group s contents) or 
for recommending groups (reducing the number of groups created and thereby reducing the number of revisits). 
 Label Quality Recall that our mechanism for comparing label quality is to measure label consistency 
of pairs of items that two independent coders agreed should belong together (described under Conditions 
and Tasks). We computed label consistency via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [17], a common and recommended 
metric for computing agreement between some partitioning of data (defined by participant labels in our 
case) and some ground truth (defined by data our coders agreed upon) by examining pairs [25]. Intuitively, 
ARI computes the proportion of pairs that should (and should not) have ended up together (or not) over 
all possible pairs and is adjusted for chance groupings. We used the could be items that our two experimenters 
independently labeled and agreed upon as our ground truth partitioning (i.e., where pairs grouped together 
by both annotators were considered similar and those not grouped together were dissimilar). This amounted 
to 231 pairs to measure ARI over. Note that whether or not a participant considered any item as belonging 
to their concept is irrelevant to measuring label consistency (and irrelevant to ARI). Instead, we only 
care that pairs of items that should be together end up together. For example, if a user placed two items 
together in a group 4 10 2 5 0 0 Baseline Manual Assisted Baseline Manual Assisted Figure 5. Average 
number of pages and groups participants revised (left) or revisited (right) during the first half of 
the experiment (light) and last half (dark).  in the yes category, the ARI measure would still mark 
them as together, even if our ground truth marked these as together in a group in the could be category). 
Our analysis showed a significant effect of interface condition on label consistency according to our 
ARI metric (X2=6.53, df=2, p<.038). Pairwise tests showed that participants labeled data significantly 
more consistently in both the manual (Z=-2.329, p=.02) and assisted structuring (Z=-2.329, p=.02) conditions 
than in the baseline condition. No difference was found between the manual and assisted structured labeling 
conditions (Z=-0.852, p=.394). These results (shown in Figure 6) suggest that structured labeling did 
improve the quality of participants labeled data, helping them to label items in a more consistent manner. 
 Labeling Speed To investigate the impact of structuring on labeling speed, we measured the total time 
it took participants to complete the labeling task in each condition. We found that participants in the 
baseline condition finished labeling in approximately 10 minutes on average, versus nearly 15 minutes 
for the structured labeling conditions (X2=14.93, df=2, p<.001). Pairwise tests revealed that the differences 
between the baseline and manual (p=.003) and the baseline and assisted (p<.001) structured labeling tools 
were significant (Figure 7). We also examined how quickly participants initially labeled individual pages 
with each interface. That is, we measured how long it took participants to examine pages the first time 
they appeared and decide on an initial label for it. We did not include time they may have spent revisiting 
that page when refining their concepts. From this analysis, we found a difference in initial label speed 
between the baseline and manual structured labeling (with baseline being faster), but no difference between 
the baseline and the assisted structured labeling (X2=6.40, df=2, p=.040; pairwise test between baseline 
and manual p=0.016, no statistically significant differences between the other pairs). These results 
suggest that our assisted supports might help to mitigate some of the costs of structuring labels. Additionally, 
we examined how long it took participants to initially label the first 50% of pages versus the last 50%, 
with the intuition that people might be able to apply labels faster once their structuring was established. 
While we found no significant differences in speed from beginning to end, we found that by the end of 
their tasks the differences in time to label between the baseline and manual and between the baseline 
and assisted conditions decreased (Figure 8). These changes may be due to a stabilization of participants 
structuring as they progressed. Indeed, examining when participants modified their structures, we found 
that of the 100 pages that were re-examined at least once across all users, 69 were presented during 
the first half of the task, while only 31 were presented during the second half.  User Attitudes and 
Preferences To reveal a larger picture of the impacts of structured labeling, we examined user attitudes 
and preferences for each interface, as well as their self-reported concept changes. At the end of the 
study, we asked participants to rank each tool in order of preference. Figure 9 illustrates an upward 
trend with more participants ranking the manual structuring tool as their favorite than baseline, and 
more still ranking the assisted structured labeling tool as their favorite. We also see the opposite 
trend for participants least favorite tool, with the baseline tool ranked last most often. Participants 
comments provided some insight as to why they might have preferred the assisted structuring tool. For 
example, some participants appreciated the group recommendations: Power of suggestion possibly? It helped 
with the sorting process but also make you subconsciously say wait, that s not right . It wasn t loud 
and in your face. Assisted grouping was best because you were really OK ing (or not) what the computer 
guessed. Otherwise the three simple categories were quickest. Similarly, another participant said that 
without the recommendation feature, he would have preferred the unstructured labeling tool (which he 
ranked as his second favorite) because it was less complex: Simple can be useful. Suggestions were extremely 
helpful. Categories introduced complexity to the system. This idea that simple can be useful was echoed 
by other participants, particularly the three who preferred the unstructured labeling tool. However, 
even among this group, there was an awareness that the assisted structuring tool could be useful in the 
right circumstances: I favored the more simple the better [sic] [baseline] But when I didn t know the 
topic very well, such as Gardening , I was hoping for some assistance in [similar pages] and  Baseline

was particularly helpful when working with unfamiliar topics, including how the tool helped her keep 
more categories in her mind at once: I think I created more groups this time because I m not as familiar 
with the topic, so in my mind I wanted to have more categories. Finally, it is worth noting that participants 
were aware their concept definitions were changing more often while they were engaged in structured labeling 
than when using the baseline interface (Figure 10). Friedman rank sum tests showed a significant main 
effect of interface condition on concept change awareness (X2=9.91, df=2, p=.007), and pairwise comparisons 
confirmed a significant difference between baseline and assisted structured labeling (p=.016).  DISCUSSION 
We illustrated the concept evolution problem with a series of formative studies, demonstrating that concept 
evolution impacts people s ability to label data consistently. We then introduced structured labeling 
as a novel approach to dealing with concept evolution. Our controlled experiment showed that people used 
and preferred structured labeling over traditional labeling, and that structured labeling improves label 
consistency but at a cost of speed. However, we also wanted to revisit a finding from one of our formative 
studies that concept evolution can result in the same people making different labeling decisions on the 
same data at different times. In particular, we wanted to determine if structured labeling can improve 
label consistency in this situation. We conducted a small follow up study with eight machine learning 
experts. We asked our participants to label 100 web pages from the gardening concept and then come back 
ten days later to re-label the same data (the ordering of the data was shuffled between sessions). Four 
of our participants used our baseline tool and four used our assisted structured labeling tool. Consistency 
was computed as in our formative study on participants high-level categorizations (i.e., yes , no , could 
be ) from the first session to the next. From this study, we found that structured labeling helped people 
arrive at more consistent structuring decisions when labeling the same data ten days apart. Participants 
in the baseline condition showed 86.3% consistency on average 8 7 4 3.5 0 0 Baseline Manual Assisted

while those in the structured labeling condition averaged 90.9% (SD=5.6%). In addition, three of the 
participants using the baseline interface arrived at significantly different labels after ten days (computed 
via McNemar-Bowker tests of symmetry), while only one of the structured labeling participant s labels 
were significantly different from one session to the next. These findings suggest further investigation 
of the impact of structured labeling on consistency of labeling decisions over time is warranted. Binary 
labeling, however, is not the only potential use for structured labeling. Other tasks that require consistent 
labels (e.g., multi-class classification, entity extraction) may also benefit, though additional supports 
for managing more classes or complex inputs may be necessary. Further, the labeling structure itself 
may be useful to both humans and machines. Labeling guidelines or rules can emerge directly from the 
structured labeling process, and tools such as our prototype could be used to share these guidelines 
as a collection of exemplars rather than as written rules. Machine learners may also benefit from this 
structure; for example, items in certain groups could be reweighted, model selection could explore different 
combinations of groups, and groupÂ­specific features could be identified.  CONCLUSION This paper introduced 
the notion of concept evolution in machine learning and made the following contributions: . Results from 
three formative studies illustrating the impact of concept evolution in machine learning. . A novel interaction 
technique for helping people evolve concepts during labeling (structured labeling), and two tools instantiating 
this technique. . Results from a controlled experiment comparing structured labeling to traditional labeling 
in machine learning, showing that structuring was used and preferred by participants and helped them 
label more consistently, but at a cost of speed (particularly early in labeling). . Results from a follow 
up experiment comparing label consistency over time, showing that structured labeling helped participants 
recall their earlier labeling decisions and increased their consistency over time. Taken together, these 
results reveal the pervasiveness of the concept evolution problem from machine learning practitioners 
developing systems for widespread deployment to end users providing training data to their personal classifiers. 
Structured labeling provides a solution to concept evolution and is a further step on the road toward 
helping people meaningfully interact with machine learners. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the CHIL team and
