T1	IDK_MAN 93 514	High performance computing (HPC) has driven collaborative science discovery for decades. Exascale computing platforms, currently in the design stage, will be deployed around 2022. The next generation of supercomputers is expected to utilize radically different computational paradigms, necessitating fundamental changes in how the community of scientific users will make the most efficient use of these powerful machines.

Then in another case I will have a job which might be there for a day or half a day and it is down to 100 in the queue apparently, and the next time I look it's at 1500, then it starts.
