Several methods based on dynamical assumptions were suggested for determination of the P-parity of the Θ+ [13]. According to a general theorem [14], in order to determine the parity of one particle in a binary reaction one has to know polarizations at least of two fermions participating in this reaction. Model independent methods for determination of the P-parity of the Θ+ were suggested recently in Refs. [15,16] for pp-collision, and in Ref. [17] for photoproduction of the Θ+. The method of Refs. [15,16], based on the assumption that the spin of the Θ+ equals 12, suggests to measure the spin–spin correlation parameter in the reaction p→p→→Σ+Θ+ near the threshold. We generalize here this method for an arbitrary spin of the Θ+ and both isospins T=0 and T=1 of the NN channel of the NN→YΘ+ reaction. Furthermore, we consider a polarization transfer from a nucleon to the hyperon Y in this reaction. Our consideration is model independent, since it is based only on conservation of the P-parity, total angular momentum and isospin in the reaction and the generalized Pauli principle for nucleons.
