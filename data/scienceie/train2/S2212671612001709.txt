An algorithm of multi-axis NC tool-path generation for subdivision surfaces is proposed. The algorithm includes two steps: model building and tool path generation. In the section of model building, in order to obtain the deformed surface, the deformation vector is computed which is associated with the curvature and the slope of cutter location surface. In the procedure of tool path generation, the slicing procedure is adopted to get the CL points. In addition, the inversely converted method is used. The method is tested by some examples with actual machining. The results show that the method can effectively reduce the error of the scallop height for subdivision surface and obtain the better shape and quality. In addition, the computational complexity and is scalable and robust.
