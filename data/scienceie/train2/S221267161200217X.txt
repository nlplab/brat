The existing GO methodology algorithm is theoretical, and hard to solve with computer. In this paper, we research a new method to get the reliability of system based on GO methodology. According to some properties of the operators in GO chart, GO chart can be transformed into series structure, then the minimal path sets are induced based on Enumeration method from first operator to last one. It is very convenient for computer to calculate the system reliability with the new method based on minimal path sets. The case study indicates the method is suitable for practical engineering, which can be used to possess the quantitative analysis of complex GO methodology models.
