Introduction  In recent years, several researchers have given emphasis on modifying curriculum, which is more useful for  software industry [1][2]. The basic motivation behind this is to produce more practical software engineers for  fulfilling the requirement of software industry. In fact, the failure of measurable number of software in the  industry forces to find out the loop and holes in the system [3]. The lack of proper training and education,  which is relevant to industry, is one of the reasons for this crisis. In a survey [4], it is observed that several  important software engineering related topics are not covered in curriculums of informatics related branches.   Software Project Management (SPM) teaches the fundamental practices of good project management  needed by ICT practitioners [5]. It explains how people, processes and problems are managed, how effort, cost   2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, a  team/project leader should have the above qualities. In practice, a person becomes a team leader after gaining  some experience in software development or related activities but it is not necessary that with experience he  acquired all qualities, which are required for a project leader.   Majority of software developers in the industry are simply graduated in different disciplines related to  informatics: computer engineering (CE)/science (CS), information system engineering (ISE), and software  engineering (SE). All these software engineers will be the IT managers and they will have responsibilities of  managing big tasks, teams and handling the complex projects. However, most of them do not have any  practical training for project management. They gain the knowledge of project management only by  experience, which certainly may not be sufficient to be a successful team leader.    This article explores the situation and availability of software project management course in Turkish  universities. In the next sections, we are performing an analysis based on data collected from Turkish  Universities on this matter. Discussions and conclusions follow afterwards.   2. Analysis of curriculums of CE related departments and role of SPM course  As mentioned earlier, we aim to highlight the role of project management course in the academic  curriculum of departments in the field of informatics in Turkish universities. These departments are computer  engineering, software engineering, information systems engineering and computer science. Almost all of the  curriculums of computer engineering departments in Turkey show significant similarities to computer science  departments in western countries.  However, since the establishment of the first department in Middle East  Technical University in 1967, the departmentsâ€™ preferred title appears to be computer engineering. This is  because of the fact that engineering graduates have some advantages according to the â€œstate personnel lawâ€�  and have more popularity in the society in Turkey. Currently, the total number of universities is 168 in the  country. Of these universities, 40 (25 state+15 private) do not have any CE and CE related departments. The  number of CE and related departments in these universities is 143 (Table 1). This means some of the  universities may have more than one CE and related departments.  Table 1. Distribution of CE and related departments  Universities CE(#) SE(#) ISE(#) CS(#)  State 1 2 0 2 Private 3 4 2 9  TOTAL 5 6 2 11   Actually, the chi-square test results indicated significant relationship between the university categories  (state and private) and types of departments (chi-sq =0.001; df = 3; p-value=0.001). In other words, state and  private universities are using different strategies in the establishment of informatics related departments. This  is probably because private universities are considering not only CE departments but also SE, ISE and CS  departments.   For some of the universities the curriculum data was not available due to different reasons such as  inaccessibility, unavailability or nonexistence of departmentâ€™s web site or curriculum information etc. The  distribution of accessed departments is given in Table 2 and this table is used in further analysis.  405 Sanjay Misra et al. /  IERI Procedia  4 ( 2013 )  403 â€“ 407  Table 2. Distribution of accessed CE and related departments  Universities CE(#) SE(#) ISE(#) CS(#)  State 32 0 0 1 Private 37 10 2 7  TOTAL 69 10 2 8   The distribution of software engineering related courses (SE: Software Engineering; QA: Quality  assurance; PM: Project Management) in CE departments of state and private universities are given in Table 3.  Table 3. Distribution of SE related courses in universities  CE Dept. SE course QA course PM course State Univ. 28 0 1  Private Univ. 32 2 5    It can easily be observed from the table given above that software related courses have more weight in the  curriculums of computer engineering departments in private universities than their state counterparts.  However, the chi-square test results indicate non-existence of a significant difference between state and  private universitiesâ€™ computer engineering curriculums in terms of existing software courses (chi-sq =  1.942;  df = 2; p-value = 0.379). Additionally, chi-square goodness-of-fit tests clearly state the rejection of the  hypotheses meaning there is no significant difference between the SE course and others (QA and PM courses)  in state (chi_sq= 0.0 df= 2 p-value=1.000) and private (Chi_sq = 0.0 df= 2 p-value=1.000) universities. This  means almost all of computer engineering departments include an SE course in their curriculums. However,  this is the just opposite for other software engineering related courses such as quality assurance and project  management. Among these courses project management has a special importance since quality of a software  highly depends on the project management in a Software Development Project (SDP). It is easy to imagine  the level of complexity for resource planning, budgeting, scheduling, supplier logistics, staff coordination and  leadership required to deliver such a project on time and on budget considering a large SDP. According to  Schwalbe (Schwalbe, 2004), the average time overrun is 163% in 2001 and 227% in 1995, and average cost  overrun is 145% in 2001 and 189% in 1995 in SDPs.  In general speaking, it is difficult to keep the productivity and quality at a significant level in an SDP  because software is not visible and is developed as a result of brainwork. Mainly, a project team is organized  to create software, in which case human relationships and work environment affect productivity and quality.  This makes project management to be one of central issues in management of technology, engineering and  human resource in an SDP. Therefore, it is important to study the project management of software  development for the cost of management and the quality control [8].   Project Management uses a systematic and disciplined approach to develop software since previous  research has documented that software projects are frequently prone to escalation [9] Project Management  activities mainly include: determining the scope of the project, project planning, implementation of project  components in a timely manner, review of activities, and a listing of courses learned during the project [10].  These activities follow the typical life cycle of a software project and a Software Project Management Plan  (SPMP) can be used to outline the structure of the project and how it will be managed. The SPMP will outline  all project management activities including configuration management and team management/roles [10].  406   Sanjay Misra et al. /  IERI Procedia  4 ( 2013 )  403 â€“ 407  These imply that it is necessary to give students a fundamental knowledge for project management including  nine areas of project management such as [11]  x Cost Management,  x Risk Management,  x Scope Management,  x Resource Management,  x Communications Management,  x Quality Management,  x Time Management,  x Procurement Management,  x Integration Management.  3. Discussion and Recommendation  Once we analyse the course curriculum of the mentioned universities we find that majority of the  universities have the software engineering course in computer engineering and computer science departments.  Sometimes software project management is introduced in the software engineering course. Students learn  variety of courses related to basic sciences, i.e. mathematics, physics and chemistry (Sometimes too much  emphasis is given on these courses [3][6][10], computer languages such as C++, JAVA, PHP; hardware  courses such as computer organization, operating systems; and software courses such as  Web- design/development and some database and networking courses. However, they do not gain much knowledge  about software project management and other related skills [12]. It was observed that, in all informatics  related disciplines (i.e. CE, CS, ISE, SE), software project management is - not a core/must course in the  curriculum. We also observed that in the universities which have a software engineering department/program  and another informatics related department, the undergraduate students of informatics related department have  the chance of taking SPM course given by software engineering department as a technical elective. It is worth  mentioning that majority of the software engineers in industry are from computer engineering and other  related disciplines but not from software engineering.  It is because software engineering is not available in  majority of universities and also it is not as popular as other computer science related discipline (e.g. CE, CS  and ISE). Software project management is also given as an elective course in master programs of computer  engineering in universities. However, majority of the software developers do not want to attend master  programs in computer science/engineering, except they are interested to switch to academic life, which is  normally a rare situation/case. Some of them prefer to go for master program in business administration to  improve their skills in project management.  As a result, majority of graduates are not able to learn the  principles of SPM.   Most of the software companies have 5-20 employees in Turkey and, therefore, can be considered as either  Small or Medium size Enterprises (SMEs). Additionally, majority of the software personnel in these  companies are inexperienced professionals, who will be expected to act as project/team leaders soon after  their graduation without having a formal training on PM. For this reason, big software companies like IBM,  Motorola, CISCO, Microsoft provide inhouse training to their staff so they normally do not possess any crises  for lack of trained staff in project management. However, due to several constraints and problems of SMEs,  trained and experienced professionals are scarce [13]. By considering all the above mentioned discuss, it is  highly recommendable that SPM should be introduced as a core course in undergraduate curriculum of all  informatics related branches so that students gain some knowledge regarding SPM during their educational  training.  Furthermore, the high load of other courses such as mathematics in the curriculum of computer  science [14] and computer engineering [15] should be reduced and more emphasis on subjects, which make  407 Sanjay Misra et al. /  IERI Procedia  4 ( 2013 )  403 â€“ 407  the software engineering education more practical [16] should be given. Some of the literature considers  business as one these fields [17].  4. Conclusion  SPM is an important course for practitionerâ€™s point of view. However, our observation reflects that this  course has not been given proper emphasis in the curriculum of undergraduate departments of CE, CS, ISE.   Lack of proper knowledge in project management is one of the major reasons for not achieving the objectives  of the projects. In this point of view, this course should be included as core/must course in all informatics  related disciplines, which graduates the software engineers of the future.

However, due to several constraints and problems of SMEs,  trained and experienced professionals are scarce [13]. By considering all the above mentioned discuss, it is  highly recommendable that SPM should be introduced as a core course in undergraduate curriculum of all  informatics related branches so that students gain some knowledge regarding SPM during their educational  training.  Furthermore, the high load of other courses such as mathematics in the curriculum of computer  science [14] and computer engineering [15] should be reduced and more emphasis on subjects, which make  407 Sanjay Misra et al. /  IERI Procedia  4 ( 2013 )  403 â€“ 407  the software engineering education more practical [16] should be given. Some of the literature considers  business as one these fields [17].  4. Conclusion  SPM is an important course for practitionerâ€™s point of view. However, our observation reflects that this  course has not been given proper emphasis in the curriculum of undergraduate departments of CE, CS, ISE.   Lack of proper knowledge in project management is one of the major reasons for not achieving the objectives  of the projects. In this point of view, this course should be included as core/must course in all informatics  related disciplines, which graduates the software engineers of the future.

During the process of production several times the product fails due to lack of proper management. This paper is exploring the role of software engineering courses in computer engineering related branches and then reasons why software developers lack project management in proper software management trainings. Our findings reflect that in majority of computer related branches like computer science, computer engineering, information system engineering there is no place for software project management course. Our findings are based on a survey of course curriculums of computer engineering, computer science and information system engineering courses taught in Turkish universities.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:keywords id="kwd0005" class="keyword" view="all"><ce:section-title id="sect0010">Keywords</ce:section-title><ce:keyword id="kw0005"><ce:text>Project Management</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0010"><ce:text>Software Industry</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0015"><ce:text>Computer Engineering</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0020"><ce:text>Computer Science</ce:text></ce:keyword></ce:keywords></head><tail view="all"><ce:bibliography id="bibl0005" view="all"><ce:section-title id="sect0020">References</ce:section-title><ce:bibliography-sec id="bibs0005" view="all"><ce:bib-reference id="bib0005"><ce:label>[1]</ce:label><ce:other-ref id="oref0005"><ce:textref>Hussey M, Wu B, Xu X.
