For mixtures described by an equation of state, this calculation amounts to simultaneously solving the condition of thermal, mechanical and diffusive equilibria (equality of chemical potential) amongst two fluid phases for each component of the mixture. The analytical nature of this calculation lends itself to a reasonably rapid solution by numerical methods. In its most common form, the composition and temperature are fixed and the pressures at either the bubble or the dew point are recursively calculated. The reader is referred to the excellent textbooks that describe the common algorithms employed [80â€“82]. The quality of the result is obviously limited by the accuracy of the EoS to faithfully represent fluid mixtures. Furthermore, the fact that some of the more interesting features of the phase diagram are close to the critical points of the mixture, make these calculations particularly challenging for all but the most optimized and force-fitted of models.
