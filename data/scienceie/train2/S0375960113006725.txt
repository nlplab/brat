Observations show that in the same area with dimensions of a few tenths of a parsec could be many sources, some of which only emits OH lines, and some – only lines H2O. The only known in physics the emission mechanism that can give tremendous power within a narrow range of the spectrum, is coherent (i.e. the same phase and direction) light lasers, which are called optical lasers, and radio-masers. Cosmic maser radio sources emitting in the lines of the molecules have an extremely high brightness temperature radiation Tb. In the molecules of methanol masers (CH3OH) Tb value can reach 109 K, with masers hydroxyl molecules (OH) 6×1012 K. The typical size of the maser clusters is about 1014–1015 m and the neutron star radius is of the order of 10 km. Thus, the radiation dilution coefficient is equaled approximately (2.5×10−23)–(2.5×10−21) and, therefore, μB2B2/4(hν)2∼(2.4×10−5)–(2.4×10−7) for the hydrogen line 21 cm and of the order 10−5–10−7 for the OH 18 cm line or the same order as Eq. (1).
