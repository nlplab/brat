Many models have been propounded for forecasting lightning. Though majority of the model had shown accuracy, the response time in detecting natural phenomenon is quite low. In this model, we used the mathematical experimentation of the micro scale plasmas to develop the macro scale atmospheric plasma which we believe is a major influence of lightning. The Schr√∂dinger-electrostatic algorithm was propounded to further increase both the accuracy and alacrity of detecting natural phenomena. According to our theoretical experimentation, the air density plays a major role in lightning forecast. Our guess was verified using the Davis Weather Station to track the air density both in the upper and lower atmosphere. The air density in the upper atmosphere showed prospect as a vital factor for lightning forecast.
