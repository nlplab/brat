The iron ore may be extracted from blocks of 25×25×12meter3 located at three consecutive mining benches of 12meter height. For this case study, ten equally probable scenarios of iron content, phosphorous, silica, aluminum and LOI are used to quantify the joint uncertainty in the characteristics of the iron ore deposit considered and are the input to the SSTPS formulation proposed in the previous section. The simulated scenarios available were provided and generated using the stochastic simulated technique detailed in Boucher and Dimitrakopoulos (2012). The area considered is bounded by the limits of the given volume of production in the long-term first year production schedule provided. Fig. 4 shows 3 scenarios of iron ore content as well as the corresponding conventional and single estimated (average) representation of iron content (Fe2O3%) for the upper bench. In total, 734 blocks from 3525 to 21,150 tonnes, with Fe2O3 from 54.59% to 60.63%, P from 0.02% to 0.04%, SiO2 from 3.10% to 8.58%, Al2O3 from 0.53% to 1.88% and LOI from 8.75% to 11.75% are available.
