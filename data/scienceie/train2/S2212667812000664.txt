According to the shortcomings of long time and big errors about the moving plate recognition system, we present the moving plate recognition algorithm based on principal component analysis(PCA) color extraction. On the basis of the analysis of moving plate recognition system's basic principles, it introduces the basic principles and calculation steps about PCA extraction algorithm, and discusses the feasibility of applying the algorithm to PRS in the paper. The experimental results show that the algorithm has the advantages of faster speed and higher accuracy of recognition. The algorithm provides a new thought for the research on the moving plate recognition algorithm.
