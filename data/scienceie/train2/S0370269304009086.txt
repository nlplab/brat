The ART model is a hadronic transport model that includes baryons such as N, Δ(1232), N∗(1440), N∗(1535), Λ, Σ, and mesons such as π, ρ, ω, η, K, K∗. Both elastic and inelastic collisions among most of these particles are included by using the experimental data from hadron–hadron collisions. The ART model has been quite successful in explaining many experimental observations, including the surprisingly large kaon antiflow [11,12] in heavy ion collisions at AGS energies. The ART model also allows us to understand whether or not the strongly interacting matter formed in these collisions reaches chemical and/or thermal equilibrium. In the present study, we extend the ART model to include perturbatively the Ξ particle as in the studies for other rare particles using the transport model [6,13,14].
