Knowledge Management (KM) is one of the hotspots for research in the past decade. In most cases, the number of users in a Knowledge Management System (KMS) is very large, and they are from varied departments, even other companies. In this paper, some defects when existing methods about access control and recommendation are deployed in KMS are analyzed to show that these widely-used approaches need to be extended. To overcome the deficiencies of previous work, this paper proposes an extended Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) method and a hybrid recommendation approach for Knowledge Management System. Also, a real-life system is presented to verify the proposed methodology.
