The proposed design included pipelines or ductsand hot air receiving chambers for the Varnish Plant.Heat from the exhaust gas which would have otherwise, gone wasted, was utilised by redesigning the varnish plant and this yielded 6.74kW of heat energy which was transferred into the air chambers to aid the drying ofmatchets at the hardening plant. Consequently, the absorption of the moisture on the steel and the dryness of the product were improved. Further studies were done to ensure constant supply of hot air into the air chambers.</dc:description><openaccess>1</openaccess><openaccessArticle>true</openaccessArticle><openaccessType>Full</openaccessType><openArchiveArticle>false</openArchiveArticle><openaccessSponsorName/><openaccessSponsorType>ElsevierWaived</openaccessSponsorType><openaccessUserLicense>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/</openaccessUserLicense><dcterms:subject>modification</dcterms:subject><dcterms:subject>heat

Simons /  IERI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  25 â€“ 31    The general problem of rusting of steels due to presence of moisture on them before it goes through the  varnish solution can be eliminated. This can be done by operating between working temperature of 35  o C and  38  o C at the varnish plant.    The excess heat from the exhaust gas going waste into the environment at the hardening plant can be  tapped by using pipes and then introduced into a chamber. The conveyor carrying the matchet passes through  this chamber to get rid of any moisture on the matchet before and after they have been immersed in the  varnish solution.    2.1. A brief look at theory    2.1.1. Pipe insulation    According to Simons and Nunoo, 2008 insulation of pipe is a thermal insulation used to prevent heat loss  and heat gain from pipes to save energy and improve on the effectiveness of the thermal systems.  Consequently, pipe insulation helps to reduce the cost of production of heat.    Considering composite pipe (i.e. pipe with several lagging) the heat transfer (Q t ) can be calculated by  using Fourierâ€™s and Newtonian law of heat transfer. It is expressed mathematically as (Cengel and Turner,  2001);    Q t  = t R T            (1)    where  is the temperature difference between the fluid in the pipe and the ambient air,R T  is the total thermal  resistance.    The convection heat transfer coefficient of air inside a pipe is calculated using the relation;           (2)    wherek is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, D i  is inner diameter of the pipe, Re is Reynolds number (Re &gt;  2500), C p is the specific heat capacity of the fluid, Î¼ is the viscosity of the fluid and n = 0.4 when the fluid is  being heated and 0.3 when the fluid is to be cooled.    2.1.3. Heat exchanger    Heat exchanger is an equipment which transfers heat energy from hot fluid to a colder one with maximum  rate and minimum investment, and running cost(Simons and Nunoo, 2008).     The heat gain (Q c ) through the exchanger is given as;              (3)    where  is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the area of the pipe and t in is the log mean temperature difference.    The logs mean temperature can be found by the expression;  28   E. K. Gbadam and A. Simons /  IERI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  25 â€“ 31          (4)    where  is the difference between final temperature of  hot fluid and that of the cold fluid,  is the  difference between initial temperature of  hot fluid and that of the cold fluid.    3. Design Analysis    3.1. Design of pipe    When the materials of the pipe have been decided on, then the most important parameters to calculate for  are the internal diameter of the pipe and the thickness of the pipe. The internal diameter depends on the flow  rate and the velocity of the fluid flowing through the pipe. This calls for selection of appropriate blower to  extract or blow atmospheric air into the pipe.     Blowers depend on the speed of the motor which revolve the fan. For this work, the length (L) of the pipe  is 29 m that is from the chimney to the varnish container. Therefore assuming mean velocity (V) of the fluid  flowing through the pipe to be 30 m/s and selecting blower with rating of; horse power (10 hp), flow rate (Q)  of 35 m 3 /min, and speed of the motor to be 3820 rpm.    With a blower rating of 35 m 3 /min and velocity of 30 m/s of air flowing through the pipe, the diameter can  be found.     Now given Quantity of fluid carried per minute or flow rate (Q)  = 35 m 3 /min  Velocity fluid flowing through the pipe (V)  = 1800 m/min    Thus the internal diameter of the pipe is given as;      Using Lameâ€™s equation,the thickness of the pipe is calculated as;        whereallowable stress or design stress  = 74 N/mm 2  (Sharma and Aggarwal, 2003)  Internal pressure of the pipe (P)  = 1.9 N/mm 2   Weisback constant (C) for steel  = 3  The internal diameter of the pipe  = 158 mm    The outer diameter of the pipe is     Comparing the design values with those in standard steel pipe table, the selected pipe have internal diameter  of 150 mm, outer diameter of 168.3 mm and thickness of 5.4 mm.  29 E. K. Gbadam and A. Simons /  IERI Procedia  1 ( 2012 )  25 â€“ 31  3.3. Source of heat    A chimney is a hollow structure that allows exhaust gas or steam from a furnace or fire to escape into the  atmosphere. The temperature of the fluid inside the chimney is 700 ÂºC. To gain heat and utilize it for the  purpose of absorbing moisture on the steel and improving the dryness of the matchet after varnishing, a pipe  is introduce into the chimney as shown in Fig. 2.                      Fig. 2. Sectional view of the chimney and the inserted pipe    Air at a temperature of 27 ÂºC is blown into the pipe to exchange heat with the exhaust gas from the furnace  in the chimney. The desire temperature that should be in the hot air line is 80 ÂºC and to achieve this depends  on the length of the pipe introduce intothe chimney as shown in Fig. 3. The mean bulk  temperature .    Interpolating between 320 K and 350 K when mean bulk temperature is 327 K, the properties of the fluid  were found to be as follows:    C p  = 1.0081 , Î¼ = 197.344  kg/ms, k = 28.298  kW/mK, Pr = 0.7032, W =18.6062   m 2 /s and   = 1.0715     The flow rate (Q) was assumed to be 35 m 3 /min and the calculated diameter (Di) of the pipe is 0.15 m. The  actual velocity (V a ) of fluid flowing through the pipe is;    and     Hence heat gain from the chimney is;        3.4. Heat loss in the pipe    The temperature of fluid flowing through the hot air line is 80 ËšC and that outside the surface of the pipe is  27ËšC as shown in Fig. 3. Given the following data;    Internal diameter of steel pipe (D i )  = 0.15 m  Outer diameter of steel pipe (D o )  = 0.1683m  Outer diameter of fiberglass (d o )  = 0.2791 m  Thermal conductivity of steel (k)  = 50.2   Thermal conductivity of fiberglass (k f ) = 0.04   Length of pipe (L)   = 29 m    Chimney   Pipe   30   E.

Hot air receiving chamber    The main purpose of this work is to eliminate the problem of rusting by finding a way to get rid of any  moisture content on the steel before it goes through the varnish solution and to dry the matchet faster for  packaging. This calls for the use of hot air receiving chamber (i.e. preheats and postheat chamber). Both  chambers receive hot air gained from the exhaust gas of the hardening plant, but the preheat chamber ensures  that any moisture on the steel passing through the chamber is absorbed while the postheat chamber also  ensures quick dryness of the matchet for packing. Galvanized sheet is considered for this work based on the  above factors and fiberglass is used to insulate the chambers to prevent excessive heat loss to the environment.  The proposed design of the varnish plant is shown in Fig. 4.          Fig. 4. Proposed design of the varnish plant    4. Conclusions    It could be concluded that implementation of the proposed design will enable:   a gain of 6.74 kW of heat from the exhaust gas of the hardening plant   the removal or absorption of any moisture on the steel before it goes through the varnish solution   quick dryness of the matchet after it had gone through the varnish solution for packaging   the Varnish plant to operate during night shift.
