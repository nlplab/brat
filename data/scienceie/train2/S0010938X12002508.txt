The study outlines a trial of transient response analysis on full-scale motorway bridge structures to obtain information concerning the steel–concrete interface and is part of a larger study to assess the long-term sustained benefits offered by Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) after the interruption of the protective current [1]. These structures had previously been protected for 5–16years by an ICCP system prior to the start of the study. The protective current was interrupted, in order to assess the long-term benefits provided by ICCP after it has been turned off. This paper develops and examines a simplified approach for the on-site use of transient response analysis and discusses the potential advantages of the technique as a tool for the assessment of the corrosion condition of steel in reinforced concrete structures.
