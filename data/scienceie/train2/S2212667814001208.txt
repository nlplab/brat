Improving as well as evaluating the performance of High Performance Computing (HPC) applications by migrating them to Cloud environments are widely considered as critical issues in the field of high performance and Cloud computing. However, poor network performance, heterogeneous and dynamic environments are some series of pitfalls for execution of HPC applications in Cloud. This paper proposes a new approach to improve the performance and scalability of HPC applications on Amazon's HPC Cloud. The evidence from our approach points a significant improvement in speed up and scale up with the response rate of more than 20 percent parallel efÔ¨Åciency on the Cloud in comparison to dedicated HPC cluster. We state that the EC2 Cloud system is a feasible platform for deploying on-demand, small sized HPC applications.
