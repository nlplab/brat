Introduction  Currently, employment of college graduates has become a prominent social issue in China. In particular,  the employment situation of the IT professionals, computer professional as the representative, is even more  severe. Meanwhile, the software industry demand for talent also faces considerable difficulties. A dilemma of  "difficult for graduates finding a job and difficult for software companies recruiting staff" appeared in the  software industry. This dilemma was in association with the curriculum system, more importantly was due to  * Guo Lingling. Tel.: 086-0459-6503148.  E-mail address: rain_qing@163.com.

Fundamentally speaking, the  background of higher education in china is still a replication mode to reflect the large-scale industrial  production, which emphasizes the standardization and specification.  According to the status of china's IT education and training, a series of studies were carried out in this  paper to improve the software design practical ability and innovation sense of students. A fine guidance of  incentives was built and a three-dimensional practical teaching platform for software development skills  training was created, which stimulated the driving force behind the study for professional knowledge and  software design, improving the students' enthusiasm of innovation, training excellent software development  talents.  2. Basic system of â€œtriple-drivenâ€� software development  On the basis of studying in-depth the connotation of the software development capabilities of the computer  major students, taking software development capability training as the goal, a "triple-driven" multi-level  progressive software development practical teaching system was built. The so-called "triple-driven" refers to  three â€œdrivenâ€� as following. Firstly, in the first year of students studying programming, "Interest-driven"  practical method was used. Writing simple games was taken as the main practical direction to arouse students'  programming initiative and lay a solid foundation for further studying[3-4]. Secondly, at the basic course  study stage in the second and third year of students, "competition-driven" practices were applied to encourage  students to participate in the ACM programming contest and the ministry of software talents programming  contest games. These competitions only involve knowledge of programming and algorithms designing,  without needing very extensive expertise. These competitions have the characteristics of low threshold but  great depth, which are very suitable for students to improve programming proficiency and master the skills of  algorithm analysis and designing. These competitions can train the internal strength of student to engage in  software development in the future. Thirdly, in the third and fourth year of professional courses study stage,  the students are exposed to a wide range of expertise. â€œProject-drivenâ€� practice method was adopted to allow  students to participate in the development of practical research projects. Opportunities were provided to  students to be close to the actual practices, which played an important role for students to firmly grasp the  professional knowledge and enter the software development work of IT field.  "Triple-driven" practical teaching system was designed according to the specific characteristics and  problems encountered by IT major students during the different stage of learning in the school, which matches  with the curriculum and students' level of knowledge, is compatible with students' psychological process of  change. The "triple-drivenâ€� practical system not only presents a step relationship, but also can be intensified  independently. The specific research topics include the establishment and implementation of the following  three platforms.  2.1. Basic training platform of â€œinterest drivenâ€�  The learning objectives, methods, and the wishes of the freshmen newly enrolled in are blurred. If not  promptly and effectively guided, irreparable damage would be brought to their future studying. So, the key  task of this stage is to create interest in learning. Interest in learning refers a positive understanding of  tendency and emotional state of a person in learning. From the point of view of educational psychology, the  interest is a psychological characteristics of a person tending to recognize and study for obtaining some  knowledge, is an inner strength that can push people to seek knowledge, is a motivation to learn, is the most  active and realistic psychological component in the enthusiasm for study[5]. If interested in a subject, students  could continue to concentrate on studying it and improve learning outcomes. So, it is important to stimulate  20   Tang Guowei et al. /  IERI Procedia  2 ( 2012 )  18 â€“ 23  interest in learning through some simple and interesting examples. Therefore, at the beginning of the  programming teaching, the previous theoretical boring classroom model was abandoned. Instead, some  interesting examples were introduced into the teaching, such as backgammon, Othello. The effective  introduction of these instances can allow students to understand the practicality of the program, training their  learning enthusiasm. With a certain programming foundation, the students were guided to design their own  simple games, to train the basic programming skills of the students. In the second and third year, students  were encouraged to go further in writing games by competition, a network platform was provided to students  for competing in game writing. Practical experience showed that this way can greatly stimulate students'  interest in programming, even can change students indulging in playing games into indulging in compiling  games. In the third and fourth grade, the students have learned sufficient knowledge. They can begin to try a  larger, more standardized game design. Now, the students were encouraged to form a group, to use spare time  and even graduation design period to do development work, or to carry out works of game design and game  testing, which are all very good professional practices. In short, instead of letting the students playing games  from freshman to senior, it is better to let them compiling game from freshman to senior.  2.2. â€œContest drivenâ€� ability cultivation platform  Currently in many universities, there all exists in the fundamental teaching stage of computer science  major the following problems: unreasonable allocation of hours between theoretical and practical teaching;  too stereotyped experiments in class, which have difficulty in cultivating studentsâ€™ innovation thinking; lack  of cooperative learning ability and teamwork spirit, low learning efficiency. Whatâ€™s more, it has also been  found that, on the one hand, fundamental teaching is far from practical applicationÃ¼Ã¼the fundamental  teaching subjects such as math, etc. are far from the practical application of computer major, and it is difficult  for students to understand[6-7]. On the other hand, students are eager to learn the latest computer techniques  and skills, while they dislike or even reject relatively boring fundamental subjects esp. mathematical courses.  In this way, although students can learn some computer application and development technologies quite well  in the early stage, they show ability deficiency in later further development, and lack knowledge support of  fundamental subjects.  The professional contest, such as ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest and MIIT Software  Talent Programming Contest, etc. plays a positive role in promoting the professional study of students, and  helps a lot with solving the above problems which exist in the professional teaching, specifically manifested  in:  x Cultivate studentsâ€™ self-learning ability and make up for the deficiency of talent cultivation mode  In the development of talent cultivation project, itâ€™s quite difficult to reasonably allocate theoretical and  experiment hours. In order to solve this problem, extracurricular self-experiment is the only way. In the  preparation of contest, students can choose what to learn and how to learn by themselves, according to the  various types of problems met in the process. To achieve a good result in the contest, they will make full use  of their spare time and do a lot of exercises during the contest. Though the learning of some knowledge may  be boring, they often enjoy it and will try to make everything clear because this will help with solving the  problems and is also a kind of putting what learned into practical application. This virtually makes up for the  deficiency in our teaching process, and plays a good role in promoting the teaching.  x Cultivate studentsâ€™ teamwork spirit and improve cooperative learning ability  Cooperative learning is a way to learn in the form of teamwork, and team membersÃ¿ cooperative work is  necessary to achieve the learning objectives. ACM Contest requires three persons to share one computer, and  to work out the maximum problems with great difficulty within limited time. How to give full play to three  personsâ€™ effort, allocate time reasonably and cooperate in the contest is the key to success. The knowledge  21 Tang Guowei et al. /  IERI Procedia  2 ( 2012 )  18 â€“ 23  content covered in the contest is very extensive. Team member often study in cooperation with a due division  of labor according to each oneâ€™s advantages and gather to discuss or do exercises at regular intervals, so that  they can speed up learning and understanding. Through training before contest and cooperation during contest,  studentsâ€™ thinking ability is inspired, communication ability and accommodation ability are cultivated and a  solid foundation for studentsâ€™ further job is laid.  x Make fundamental subjects work well in programming and help students in strengthening learning and  understanding.  The contest question requires multi knowledge of related subjects, and students are able to acquire much  more knowledge of fundamental subjects and improve their thinking ability by training and learning. Only  using the basic knowledge about algorithm and data structure learned in university courses is far from enough  to improve programming level. Only through exploring and gaining an insight into the knowledge of related  subjects such as discrete math, graph theory, probability theory, computation geometry, etc. using various  types of contest questions, and fully developing a kind of programming and algorithm thinking, can  contestants achieve a good result and have much more strong ability to work in the scientific research domain  in the future.  By applying contest platform reasonably, our professional teaching can be more scientific and normalized,  our studentsâ€™ horizons can be broadened, the cultivation of innovative talents can be boosted, and studentsâ€™  employment competence can be improved.  2.3.ÌŒProject drivenâ€� actual development platform  In the present university educational reform, improving studentsâ€™ innovative ability is strongly advocated,  and attracting students to take part in the scientific research project is an effective method. Scientific research  activities not only help students in expending their scope of knowledge and building a reasonable knowledge  structure, but also can satisfy their high level psychological requirements and increase their confidence of  daring to overcome difficulties and risking making breakthroughs. Therefore, scientific research is the only  road to cultivate studentsâ€™ modern way of thinking. In this process, teachers come up to students, and develop  a harmonious relationship with them. Their instruction is full of original research inspiration and achievement  and gives students gradual and imperceptible cultivation and enlightenment; at the same time, students gain  the chance to be in intimate contact with teachers, which will further inspire their enthusiasm and desire of  exploration and will be very helpful in cultivating studentsâ€™ innovative ability[8-10]. To achieve this objective,  making students recognize the enjoyment and value of scientific innovation is the key, and on this basis,  students are guided to develop their own innovative ability.  Scientific research activities focus on fostering studentsâ€™ self-learning ability and independent operation  skills; this arouses studentsâ€™ appetite for knowledge, their comprehensive thinking quality and ability to utilize  knowledge comprehensively to solve actual problems, at the same time cultivates studentsâ€™ serious attitude,  strict requirement and rigorous style toward scientific knowledge, and really improves manipulating ability  and phenomenon observation ability[11-12]. Scientific research activities add the part for studentsâ€™  manipulating, increase the interest in learning, enhance the understanding between each other, and cultivate  studentsâ€™ cooperative spirit, theoretical thinking and innovation ability; they are good for cultivating studentsâ€™  comprehensive ability such as scientific research ability, thinking ability, self-learning ability, manipulating  ability, expressing ability and cooperation ability, etc., and they will lay a solid foundation for their future  work and further study.  22   Tang Guowei et al. /  IERI Procedia  2 ( 2012 )  18 â€“ 23  3. â€œTriple-drivenâ€� implementation  In the recent years, according to studentsâ€™ psychological diversity of different period as well as disparate  characteristics of teaching content, the following teaching practices are carried out.  3.1. Freshmen  In the early stage of program learning, programming some easy games is the main practice direction; this is  done for the purpose of attracting studentsâ€™ initiative programming and this will lay a solid foundation for  further systematic learning. Teaching cases of seven simple games, namely Gobang, Reversi, Meichess and  Snake Munch, have been finished.  3.2. Sophomores and juniors  Encourage students to take part in all kinds of programming contests, in order that students can increase  their proficiency of programming, and acquire the skills of algorithm analysis and design. At the present stage,  over 20 programming groups have been set up in our university; in 2010, our university was awarded 27  provincial prizes and 6 national prizes; in 2011, awarded 45 provincial prizes and 8 national prizes; studentsâ€™  unprecedented enthusiasm of taking part in the contest soars, so it is suitable for striking while the iron is hot  and pressing on with propelling the work of this sort.  3.3. Juniors and seniors  After upperclassmen have acquired extensive professional knowledge, they are allowed to take part in the  development of actual scientific research project, and this is to provide them with very precious practice  opportunities which are close to reality. In our university, upper classmen entering the scientific research  office has already existed and is becoming more and more popular in recent years. The ratio of  undergraduates who combined their graduation projects with actual projects in 2011 was up to 68.3 percent,  and 21.4 percent of these graduation projects were directly used in the actual projects. Each research office  under the faculty of computer science is working in support of the corresponding undergraduate interest group  of scientific research. In our practice, sufficient postgraduate resources of research office directing the  undergraduate interest group of scientific research to do some appropriate research work are another form and  a powerful supplement of â€œundergraduate tutorial systemâ€� and is also a good way to cultivate postgraduates.  4. Conclusions  The â€œtriple drivenâ€� practical teaching system for skills of software development is put forward in this paper  for the first time. Beginning with â€œinterest drivenâ€�, gradually promote studentsâ€™ learner autonomy; increase  studentsâ€™ â€œinternal strengthâ€� through â€œcontest drivenâ€�; enhance employment competitive power via â€œproject  drivenâ€�; this three-dimensional grading stereoscopic practical teaching system of software development is a  set of effective methods for cultivating studentsâ€™ software development ability. Through using the â€œtriple  drivenâ€� practical teaching system to students of each grade in computer science major and related majors, the  goal of letting aimless students generate the motivation to learn and letting aspirant students acquire  opportunities to exert their potential to a larger degree has been realized and professional teaching  administrative personnel have also been provided with new ideas of practice teaching.  23 Tang Guowei et al. /  IERI Procedia  2 ( 2012 )  18 â€“ 23  Acknowledgements  This work is sponsored by the Teaching Reform of Higher Education of Heilongjiang Province of China  (Construction and Implementation of Practical Teaching System of 3-element Driven Software Development  Ability).
