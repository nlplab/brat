Selection and peer review under responsibility of Information Engineering Research Institute 113 Maha Tebaa and Said El Hajji /  IERI Procedia  10 ( 2014 )  112 â€“ 118  Cloud. Although to date, little attention has been given to the distribution of cloudâ€™s risk, and managing  multiple Clouds from a single technology platform, in the real world, by attaching your business to a supplier  single is widely regarded as a bad strategy and unacceptable risks, and that philosophy applies to cloud  provider with a single cloud, or even a single geographical area, as the case in EC2. To meet a variety of  needs, including availability, business continuity and disaster recovery, it is important to use multi-Clouds  strategies. Cloud providers themselves can fail, so for the greatest degree of protection, a company can engage  in a Multi-Clouds strategy.  In this work we present the security limitations in the single cloud, and improvements to attributes (CIRC)  through the use of a storage system in the multi-Clouds based on the consolidation of several clouds to put up  the cloud of Clouds, to manage these various clouds, we use DepSky library in order to handle the  heterogeneity of interfaces of each cloud provider. The DepSky system guarantees the availability and  confidentiality of data by using multiple providers Clouds, by the association of â€œthe algorithm of byzantine  failures tolerance, secret sharing and erasure codes cryptographicâ€�. Then we compare DepSky with other  storage mechanisms used on multi-Clouds, RACS, HAIL and ICStore that is currently under development and  addresses the security aspects (CIRC) in a layered architecture.     2. Single Cloud Computing  Cloud computing is a new way of managing its infrastructure, applications and computer data over the  Internet (VPN) by delegating administrative tasks of maintenance and supply of material resources to a third  party (Cloud Computing provider), the only way to interact with data is an interface from their smartphone or  computer, Cloud providers are essentially concerned by delivering services (PaaS, IaaS or SaaS), but ignore  the main aspect which is the protection of privacy in the Cloud, and without any responsibility or obligation  towards these customers, private data stored in plain cleartext in the virtual hard disk can be accessed by the  provider itself or by other clients accessing the same disk.   2.1. Security limitations of the Single Cloud   Security issues of data stored in cloud are still the number one barrier to adoption of cloud computing for  companies and government agencies. Security concerns are unavoidable for cloud computing to reach the  level of maturity required, as the next generation of IT. Cloud services should ensure data integrity and  provide privacy of the data stored in the cloud, but sometimes they lose control over the data stored in their  data centers, as is the case in the following examples.  a) Data Integrity  Data integrity is one of the important issues related to Cloud security issues. The transmitted data between  the client and cloud providers may be lost or corrupted, as shown in the examples bellow:  October 2009, a loss of all Sidekick users data (directories of contacts, calendars, photos) due to a server  malfunction in Dangerâ€™s data centers (Microsoft), after one year Microsoft has conceived that the majority of  lost data cannot be recovered [2].   - January 2009, servers Ma.gnolia have suffered a total loss of data due to a complete failure; the loss of  half a terabyte of data has made the process of recovery impossible, making the site essentially dead [3].   For more examples, refer to Cachinet and al [4].   b) Data Confidentiality and Privacy  Protect sensitive data such as bank details or documents healthcare should be among the priorities of cloud  providers that are either internal (malicious administrators who work in the Cloud Provider) or external  attacks. Various Cloud provider adopt various technology to resolve the problem of data privacy, but the  virtualized nature of cloud make the traditional mechanism unstable for handling the privacy risks, and the  use of the different encryption technique still limited. Garfinkel [5] gives an example of the loss of  confidentiality such as the Amazon Cloud service. This example shows that just by knowing an Amazon  114   Maha Tebaa and Said El Hajji /  IERI Procedia  10 ( 2014 )  112 â€“ 118  account password, the totality of the accountâ€™s instances and resources can be reached.  c) Data Availability  In Cloud computing the most important character that encourages customers to migrate to a cloud service,  is the high availability of services, data, and applications. If we entrust our data to a single cloud provider  andit does not contemplate a backup solution or it hosts the data in a single platform or in a same geographical  area this may increase the risk of downtime, and it impacts customers who can get stuck for several hours  without access to their data. Amazon [6] underlines in its contract that a service may be cut down at any  moment.  2.2. Homomorphic Encryption applied to the Single Cloud  Cloud providers use traditional methods to secure their customers' data (they ask customers to encrypt data  with a key before sending them to the Cloud). However when a client wants to perform processing on his data,  the cloud provider requires the decryption key. In fact, itâ€™s impossible to perform any processing on encrypted  data without decrypting. Consequently, cloud provider holds all the clear data. See [1] for examples.  a) Definition  Our proposal is to encrypt data before sending them to the cloud providers, but theyshould be decrypted,  whenever there is the need to execute calculations on them. It was impossible to hold encrypted data secured  while a third party performs calculations on them. So, to allow the Cloud provider to perform calculations on  encrypted data without decrypting them, it is necessary to use the homomorphic encryption cryptosystems.  Homomorphic encryption systems are used to perform operations on encrypted data without a secret key  (without decrypting); the client still the unique possessor of the secret key [1].  Definition:   An encryption is homomorphic, if: from Enc (a) and Enc (b) it is possible to compute Enc (f (a, b)), where f  can be one of the following operations: +, Ã—, à¹¨ and without using the private key.  We distinguish two categories of homomorphic encryption:  - The additive homomorphic encryption (addition on raw data) is the Pailler and Goldwasser-Micalli  cryptosystems.  - The multiplicative homomorphic encryption (only products on raw data) is the RSA and El Gamal  cryptosystems.  b) Limitations For homomorphic encryption systems, the speed of slow moving and large encrypted text sent, the size of  the result ciphertext after performing operations and the limited bandwidth, which depends on ISP, are the  main limitations, Also the management of private keys that totally depends on the client who does not  necessarily have a good knowledge on security, since it has delegated the management of its IT to a Cloud  Provider, so if the client loses the private key used to encrypt the data hosted in the cloud provider, it can  recover the data only in encrypted state, and therefore it can not be reused.  3. Security mechanisms in the Multi-Clouds  Multi-Clouds, Cloud of Clouds or Interclouds [7] are similar terms used to show that despite the limitations  discussed earlier and all the security problems of single Cloud, Cloud computing should not be restricted to a  single cloud, and that sensitive data should not be entrusted to a single cloud, to avoid dependency on just one  Cloud Provider. Switchingthe cloud computing from a single Cloud to multi-Clouds is mandatory to fulfil  data security.        3.1. BFT (Byzantine Fault tolerance)  Distributed computing suffers from harmful reliability problems and availability, the deployed services are  115 Maha Tebaa and Said El Hajji /  IERI Procedia  10 ( 2014 )  112 â€“ 118  becoming more open to the world, and a significant load on the servers is increasingly imposed. In addition,  the failure in deployed services, network failure that can happen unexpectedly. These questions can easily  compromise the reliability and performance of services. Replication is a key technique used to maintain  system reliability by having multiple backup servers (or redundant replicas). Replication aims to raise the  availability and performance of the system while ensuring its correctness.   The relationship between cloud computing and BFT was already studied and in recent years it has been  considered among the most important aspect in distributed systems, although these studies were purely  academic.  A BFT [8] protocol is used to manage communication between replicated systems and clients. This  protocol requires at least 3f replicas to ensure consistency between replicas of the system, where f represents  the replicas that can be byzantine.  3.2. DepSky  Bessani et al. [9] propose a virtual storage system called DepSky is a coexistence of several clouds to build  a cloud of clouds. DepSky improves the availability, integrity and confidentiality of information stored in the  cloud through the encryption, encoding and duplication of data. This allows mitigating the limitations of  individual clouds using several dependability and security techniques.   The DepSky system ensures the  availability and confidentiality of data stored in different cloud providers by using the multi-clouds  architecture and the association of â€œthe algorithm of byzantine failures tolerance, secret sharing and erasure  codes cryptographicâ€�. The DepSky architecture consists of four clouds and each cloud uses its own specific  interface. The algorithm DepSky presented in client machines as a software library allowing reading and  writing data stored in the cloud, the DepSky system consists of two algorithms:   DEPSKY-A (Available DepSky): brings the accessibility and integrity of data by duplicating storage on  different clouds using quorum methods.   DEPSKY-CA (Confidential &amp; Available DepSky): the lack of confidentiality is the major drawback of  DepSky-A because the storage of data is in cleartext, Depsky-CA algorithm encrypts data before storing them  in the multi-Clouds with a symmetric encryption, then the data is divided into block as: f+1 blocks are  necessary to recover the original data, f or less block don't give any information about the data stored in the  Multi-clouds.                                                                     Fig.1. Architecture of DepSky    116   Maha Tebaa and Said El Hajji /  IERI Procedia  10 ( 2014 )  112 â€“ 118  Fig.2. DepSky-CA Algorithm [10]  3.3. RACS (Redundant Array of Cloud Storage)  The RACS [10] system (Redundant Array of Cloud Storage) employs a RAID5-like technique (mainly  erasure codes) to implement high-available and storage-efficient data replication on diverse clouds. Generally  the purpose of RACS is to avoid vendor lock-in and its associated risks. This problematic occurs when  organizations move their data from their data centers to one cloud storage provider and later, even with  appealing offers from competition, itâ€™s expensive for clients to switch from one provider to another. Typically,  storage providers charge clients for inbound and outbound bandwidth. Therefore, the intent behind RACS is  to replicate clientâ€™s data on multiple providers, but in an economical way. Data are spread on multiple  providers, which implies redundancy to tolerate possible failures or outages. To sum up, the RACS system is  a cloud storage proxy that shares data across multiple cloud storage providers in transparent way.                  In contrast to DepSky, the RACS system does not try to solve security problems of cloud storage, but deals  with the â€œeconomic failuresâ€� and vendor lock-in concern. Thus, the system provides no mechanism of  detecting data corruption.  3.4. HAIL (High Availability and Integrity Layer)  HAIL [11] (High Availability and Integrity Layer) is a distributed cryptographic system that permits a set  of servers to prove to a client that a stored file is intact and retrievable, it's allows checking data retrievability,  but if data is deleted by malicious provider, nothing can be done. HAIL provides a software layer to address  availability and integrity of the stored data in the Interclouds. It aggregates cryptographic protocols for proof  of recoveries with erasure codes to provide a software layer to protect the integrity and availability of the  stored data, even if the individual cloud are compromised by a malicious and mobile adversary.  In contrast to DepSky, HAIL does not guarantee the privacy, needs code execution in cloud servers, it does  not allow management of different versions of data.  3.5. IC Store (Intercloud Storage)  ICStore [12] allows access to private or public cloud providers to migrate third, save or share files. The  advantage of the solution is to protect against downtime, data loss or hacker attacks. Another advantage is  filled more easily switch providers migrating all data from one cloud to another.  The ICStore Client, offers to the end client a key value store with simple read and write operations, which  is a common base service offered by commodity cloud storage providers. ICStore client consists of three core  layers that target different dependability aspects: i) confidentiality, ii) integrity and iii) reliability and  117 Maha Tebaa and Said El Hajji /  IERI Procedia  10 ( 2014 )  112 â€“ 118  consistency (RC). This layered approach allows individual layers to be switched â€œonâ€� and â€œoffâ€� to provide  different levels of dependability that are to be matched with clientâ€™s goals, also with performance and possibly  even monetary constraints in mind.   In contrast to DEPSKY, ICStore does not use the secret sharing algorithm on the provision of confidentiality.  However it is not clear if information- efficient secret sharing or some variant of this technique could  substitute the erasure codes employed on these protocols.  Table 1.

Conclusion and Perspectives  All the mechanisms discussed earlier enable storage, modification or deletion data hosted in the cloud, a  client company may also ask provider to perform processing on the data, the homomorphic encryption applied  to single cloud allows operations on encrypted data without decrypting.  The swot analysis of the different security mechanisms used in the multi-clouds allows to cloud providers  to know what is the mechanism to use to provide better security (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability)  of data stored in their data centers, and the client can understand the limitations of single cloud and the  benefits of multi-clouds, DepSky is the most reliable mechanism. The use of multi-clouds computing is not  restricted to data storage, but also performing operations on data, Our proposal is to integrate a homomorphic  cryptosystem in DepSky algorithm, precisely in the secret sharing scheme, may give better results especially  when dealing with sensitive data.
