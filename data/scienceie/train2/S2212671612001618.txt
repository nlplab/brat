This paper presents a non-fragile controller design method based on system quadratic performance optimization. For the additive controller gain variations, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-fragile state feedback controller are given and transformed to the LMI problems, which simplifies the solutions to obtain non-fragile state feedback controllers. The flight control simulation results prove the reliability and validity of the method.
