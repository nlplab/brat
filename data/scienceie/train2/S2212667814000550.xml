Theoretical  Background  We Chinese adopt the Chinese characteristic socialism. More than a hundred years ago, Marx advocated  people and nature should get along peacefully and harmoniously; while Engels thought that if humans do not  follow the natural rules, the nature will take revenge on mankind in return. The five generations of leaders in  China developed the related ideas: Mao Zedong proposed thrift and energy saving ideas, and he considered                                                             * Guan Changfu.

Problem Presentation  The development of low-carbon economy is the inevitable choice to cope with global climate change, and  it is also a deep-seated global revolution of human beingsâ€™ self-rescue. Low-carbon economy is an economic  development mode characterized by â€œlow energy consumption, low emissions and low pollutionâ€�; â€œhigh  efficiency, high efficacy and high benefitâ€�. It could help realize social and economic sustainable development.  According to relevant institutions, the gross income of the low-carbon industry amounted to $534 billion in  2008, which surpassed that total amount of aerospace and national defense industryâ€”$530 billion. It was  estimated that the annual revenues of low-carbon industry would exceed $2 trillion by 2020. For the residents  of Heilongjiang pprovince, the key to improve the ecological happiness index is to propose a kind of scientific  consumption culture that could reduce resource and energy consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide to  the utmost, and help realize a green, moderate and sustainable consumption mode.  Low-carbon consumption meets the demands of the low-carbon economy, requiring consumers to bear the  guiding ideology of sustainable development in their mind. Low-carbon consumption also requests the  consumers to make full use of every product even when it has become waste, and to reduce its emissions to  the environment when meeting their basic demands (Chen Lu, 2011). Chinese domestic scholars put forward many constructive suggestions on the residentsâ€™ lifestyle under the  low-carbon consumption mode. Unfortunately, these suggestions are mostly proposed from the national level,  whereas in Heilongjiang province, the development of low-carbon economy still faces many restrictive factors.  Social and economic development, energy structure, technological level, industrial structure and consumption  structure are imbalanced in different regions (Yu Xiaozhong, et al, 2013). While consumption culture,  consumption characteristic, consumption demand, consumption habits and consumer choice are gradually  regular.   We have to cultivate the low-carbon consumption culture in the spirit level; and to discuss the  characteristics of residentsâ€™ consuming behaviours; and to study the residentsâ€™ consumer preferences and  consumption habits. In this way, we can make clear of the residentsâ€™ consumer choices in Heilongjiang  province and help them set their way to low-carbon consumption lifestyle.  3. Low-carbon Consumption Culture â€”â€œCirculatory, Moderate, Rational, Healthyâ€�  3.1. Achieving  effective garbage recycling, and advocating circulated products consumption  The level of disposable supplies and product package consumed by the residents of Heilongjiang province  is higher and higher. And these goods run out of huge amount of energy, during the process of exploitation,  37 Changfu Guan  /  IERI Procedia   8  ( 2014 )  35 â€“ 40  purchasing, production, transportation and sales. Sometimes, if the garbage couldnâ€™t be recycled, it would  cause higher cost of the products. Recently, professional workers are appointed to classify garbage in many  cities in China. So, the urban and rural residents of Heilongjiang province should also establish a common  sense of life to classify garbage when discarding them. In this way, the garbage can be recycled.   3.2. Advocating moderate consumption, and abiding by the relevant state policies and regulations  Some residents of Heilongjiang are consuming more than what they need during their daily life, which  result in a waste of resources. Take dinners for example, according to the waiters from many large hotels in  Harbin, before the NPC and CPPCC were held in 2013, the percentage of the wasted food amounted to 25%.  After the national rectification of formalism, hedonism, bureaucratism and luxury, the number fell sharply.  Moderate consumption policy can help people from all classes keep thrifty.  3.3. Actively building civilized consumption and rational consumption of high-level  At present, Chinaâ€™s GDP has become number two in the world, and the living standards of urban and rural  residents in Heilongjiang province have been greatly improved, and people become richer. As a result, some  people start to seek for fame, showing off how successful they are by irrational luxury. Low-carbon  consumption is a rational consumption mode of high level, under the guidance of right consumption values. It  is also a conscious consumption with a clear objective and right motives. In a word, it requires us to build  consumption civilization and live harmoniously with nature.  3.4. Establishing a sense of a healthy diet, and enjoying the social benefits from low-carbon lifestyle  Many people had got various cancers for unknown reasons, after have been eating transgenic products  imported from America for years. It seemed that the worship of foreign things didnâ€™t bring people health, but  diseases. Therefore, we should establish the sense of a healthy diet in Heilongjiang province, should pay  attention to food safety, and should have dinners in the restaurants and canteens for healthy food. In this way,  we can enjoy these social benefits from low-carbon lifestyle. 4. Low-carbon Consumption â€”â€œDiversification, Networking, Fashionâ€�  When it comes to basic necessities of life, we find that the consumption is getting more and more  diversified. E-commerce is becoming a new trend through on-line shopping. The young people born in the  1980s and 1990s are leading the fashion and their parents are enjoying a retired life. Therefore, the consuming  behaviour of diversification, networking and fashion has become a basic model for the residents of  Heilongjiang province.  4.1. Diversified consuming fields and improving lifestyles  From the perspective of consumption fields, it seems that clothing, food, housing and transportation are  four major factors in peopleâ€™s daily life. Among them, clothing affects oneâ€™s appearance and an appropriate  appearance can help build a positive image; food is regarded as the basic foundation of life and green food is  beneficial for a healthy diet; living is closely linked to the environment and a house overlooking the sea or a  river can help people enjoy the clean air; it is convenient to travel by high-speed rail, air and car. Therefore,  diversified consuming fields reflect the improving life quality of the residents in Heilongjiang province.   38   Changfu Guan /  IERI Procedia  8 ( 2014 )  35 â€“ 40  4.2. Networking of consumption pattern and satisfactory consumption demand  From the consumption pattern, on-line shopping is characterized by variety, satisfactory service and low  price. Moreover, on-line shoppers come from a variety of ages. Some on-line shopping sites are popular  especially on special time days (11.11 or 12.12), such as www.taobao.com, so purchasing in bulk that saves  the amount of logistics resources and satisfies consumerâ€™s consumption demands. Meanwhile, businessmen  also make profits by discount and promotion, by which low-carbon logistics and low-carbon consumption are  achieved.  4.3. Fashionable consumption and improving demand  From the quality of consumption, the fashion leaders born in the 1980s and 1990s influence the people  born in the 1950s and 1960s imperceptibly. The productâ€™ practicality, quality and design are not the most  important things in the survey of customersâ€™ satisfaction, whereas fashion, novelty and attraction are  becoming the main elements in the survey. Itâ€™s obvious that peopleâ€™s taste for daily consumption is changing  gradually and becoming more modern and international; furthermore, their demanding level and taste are also  improving.   5. Low-carbon Consumption Preferenceâ€”â€œRiskyâ€�, â€œNeutralâ€� and â€œSecureâ€�  As far as the consumption preference categorizes are concerned, there are three types, namely: â€œriskyâ€�,  â€œsecureâ€�and â€œneutralâ€�, which are not strongly associated with the residentsâ€™ personal income in Heilongjiang  province, but also directly with its consumption motivation, consumption age and consumption profession.  The survey shows that the high-achievers with above Ìž10000 a month tend to have risky consumption  preferences. More than 45% of those will make use of the high income to reinvest. The earners with income  between Ìž5000 and Ìž10000 appear to be neutral, among whom are mostly teachers, doctors, senior  technicians and other professional people. As the â€œSandwich Generationâ€� is mostly between their 35 and 55  years old, their consuming motivation are critical childrenâ€™s education, wedding expense, parentsâ€™ pension,  family life expenditure and etc.. The people with Ìž3000 to Ìž5000 income present to be secure.This kind of  crowd under the age of 35 is the major group of consumption, who usually focus on infant nurturing and  living expenses.  Regardless of the different types of consumption preferences, under the guidance of low-carbon economy  concept, the residents of Heilongjiang province can do rational consumption among all kinds of consumption  preferences motivation, which fulfills the best utilization of wages and benefits to access to the basic  protection of the family material life.  6. Low-carbon Consumption Habitsâ€”Divergence but Progressive Convergence in Urban and Rural  Area Our special urban-rural dual structure directly determines the divergence of residentsâ€™ consumption habits  in Heilongjiang province. With the acceleration of urbanization, the divergence between urban and rural and  the progressive convergence in consumption habits become narrower. Taking the consumption attitudes for  example, the gradual convergence in financial investments is taking place, such as buying stocks to get  dividends and bonuses, purchasing life insurance and other financial species for their children, parents and  spouses, also purchasing real estate for physical investment, all of which explicates that urban and rural  residents have already seen the investment not only as a type of consumption, but also as a long-term  39 Changfu Guan  /  IERI Procedia   8  ( 2014 )  35 â€“ 40  sustainable type. Furthermore, the formation of their consumption attitudes is directly associated with the  residentsâ€™ education in our province and overall country, which objectively accelerate the process of  urbanization in reverse. The financial investment shows that the cultivation of high-level demand and  transformation of actual consumption habits have partly made implicit contribution to the low-carbon  economic development in Heilongjiang province.  7. Choice of low-carbon Consumption Lifeâ€” a lifestyle Full of Culture and Education  Low-carbon consumption life means handing off the power plug every day, reducing various standby  power consumption, tightening the faucet conveniently, turning off lights, double-sided printing in casual  occasion, traveling by green bicycle, subway and bus to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from private cars as  far as possible, shopping with a green bag instead of plastic ones, wiping hands with handkerchief to reduce  the frequency of using napkins, flushing the toilet with laundry water to achieve multiple use of water and  reduce the consumption of fresh water, reducing the usage of air conditioning and heating time with outdoors  aerobic exercise, and using clean energy as raw materials by driving new energy vehicles. What is more,  people should make emphasis on energy-saving and emission-reduction in thoughts and put them into practice  to cultivate a right consumption habits. Living a â€œlow-carbon familyâ€� life, the elegant and stylish consumption  life represents the creation of intellectual economy, and shows that you are a cultivated person. We as the  human beings in a new era, should live a high-level, high-realm, high-standard life, which is simple and  natural.  8. Developing Approaches of Low-carbon Consumptionâ€”Supporting System, Education Propaganda  and Industry Interaction  8.1. Building up the supporting system, promoting low-carbon consumption development  The Government should intensify efforts on promoting the low-carbon economic development plan, and  establish and improve the institutional supporting policies to promote the development of low-carbon  consumption. The government of Heilongjiang province should define the goals and tasks of low-carbon  economic development in various stages, providing oriented and dynamic supports for its low-carbon  economy development. With guiding various social forces to participate in the construction of low-carbon  society, the official ranks and ecological development of the city should be directly linked together, making  the energy-conservation, urban haze-governance detailed indicators for official assessment. Meanwhile, the  intellectual city construction will accelerate the ecological urbanization in Heilongjiang.  8.2. Strengthening education propaganda and multi-segment cooperation  Government should establish education propaganda system on low-carbon consumption, which can  improve the residentsâ€™ awareness of it in Heilongjiang province. A multi-agent participating, comprehensive  and sound-environmental education propaganda system should be established to cultivate the residentsâ€™ low- carbon consumption attitude and to improve their awareness. On the subject of education propaganda, it calls  for cooperation from â€œvarious segments, agencies, schools, enterprises and mediaâ€�. On the subject of  educational content, the ecological environmental crisis education should be implemented on the one hand to  enhance consumer sâ€™ awareness of the ecological crisis and their sense of responsibility; and on the other hand  the introduction of low-carbon consumption values and knowledgeable education should be given to increase  the consumer value identity and rational recognition (Huang Zhimei, Huang Fen, 2010). 40   Changfu Guan /  IERI Procedia  8 ( 2014 )  35 â€“ 40  8.3. Promoting the industry interaction, and building intellectual city  There are unique ecological tourism resources, the economic base for pension services, the Russian- oriented trade done by administrative jurisdiction city on the Chinese-Russian border, the pilot union of  national intellectual city construction, the human capital from higher education. All of those fundamental  characteristics and advantages would boost the development of low-carbon economy in Heilongjiang province  to a large degree. Low carbonization and informatization are two indivisible urban development concepts,  which mean to enforce the implementation of cloud computing and cloud storage when the development  concept is conformed, so as to make the residents live happier and more harmonious.  9. Conclusion  We should advocate lowering carbon emissions, be close to nature, and take actions from ourselves. The  residents of Heilongjiang province should cultivate this consumption culture, practicing the specific  consumption model of â€œdiversification, networking and fashionâ€�, carrying on rational consumption,  accelerating urbanization approach, forming the physical and metal care oriented, environmental protection  lifestyles, which can be studied from three-dimensional angle, namely supporting systems, education  propaganda and industry interaction. From the government level, the institutional system can drive  urbanization. From the consumption subjects, the coordination from all segments is necessary, with the  establishment of the right consumption values to achieve sustainable consumption. From the perspective of  industrial development, the upturn in growth should be achieved by the tertiary industry and trading with  Russia, so as to construct an intellectual city and to promote the upgrading of the residentsâ€™ life quality.
