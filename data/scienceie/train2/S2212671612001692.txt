The key point of robot dynamics is optimal design and control. The efficiency of robot dynamics has been the goal of researchers in recent years. Screws are used to describe dynamic problems in this paper, and an O(N) recursive robot forward dynamic algorithm is given on this. It can be easily extended to tree topology, closed loop and spatial robot systems. And three classic methods of robot dynamics are compared for easy of use. The results show that dynamics described with screws are helpful in high efficient dynamics modelling. The dynamical expressions based on screws are concise and clear. It's efficiency is high of O(N) and is linear to the degree of freedom. With the improvement of computation efficiency, it will make the real-time dynamics control become possible.
