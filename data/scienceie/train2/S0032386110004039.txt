An application of ROMP derived random copolymers is the covalent incorporation of optical sensor moieties into a polymer matrix. ROM polymers have been tested as matrix materials for the oxygen sensing phosphorescent complex platinum tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin. A correlation between the nature of the ROM polymerâ€™s side chain and the optical response of the sensor molecules has been established [34]. Several works are dedicated to the synthesis of ROMP-able optical sensor molecules such as phenantroimidazoles [35,36], europium complexes [37] or xanthene dyes [38], their random copolymerization and the evaluation of their sensing profiles in the copolymers. Another application comprises random copolymers with covalently bound eosin and/or ethyl dimethylamino benzoate units which were tested as macroinitiators for the photopolymerization of acrylates aiming at an initiator/coinitiator system which combines good polymerization activity with improved migration stability [39].
