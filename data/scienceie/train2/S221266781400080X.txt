Several inorganic flocculating agents, including FeSO4, Al2(SO4)3, FeCl3 and an organic coagulant aid PAM, were used to treat the wastewater from domestic anima and poultry breeding in this paper. The ideal operating conditions were attained by single factor experiment and orthogonal design experiment. And the ideal operating conditions are follows: the dose of FeSO4 and PAM is 135.2mg/L and 0.384mg/L respectively when keeping the pH 10; and the corresponding removal rate is 55% and 60% for COD and turbidity. Based on the experimental results, this paper analyzes the main factors that affect wastewater flocculation treatment.
