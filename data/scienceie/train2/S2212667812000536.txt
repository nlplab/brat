According to the situation that the IT students can not meet the software industry demand for qualified personnel, a “triple-driven” three-dimensional software development practical teaching system was proposed, aiming to improve the software development capabilities and innovation sense of students. This system can effectively improve students the interest of software development and the practical skills and sense of innovation, laying a solid foundation for student after graduation to rapidly integrate into the software development process, meeting the needs of software industry.
