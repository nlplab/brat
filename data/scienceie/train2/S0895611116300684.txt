In the case of PSR applied to vessels, preservation of high curvature and branches (concavities) demands a high value of the d parameter, resulting in models with high number of polygons. To cope with this problem, Wu et al. (2013) evaluates a variant of PSR (in that work referred to as scale-adaptive [SA]), which includes curvature-dependent polygonization (e.g. increasing/decreasing the size of triangles according to the local curvature) (Wu et al., 2010). In Wu et al. (2013), other methods including MC (without smoothing and decimation) are evaluated with application to vessel modeling. The authors, point at SA as a suitable method for reconstruction of vessels with applications to surgery planning. The methods evaluated by Wu et al. (2013) could be also compared with another set of techniques (known as model-based methods) (Preim and Oeltze, 2008), widely used in the context of vessel modeling for surgery planning.
