In contrast to the H particle, the situation for the Θ+ baryon is very promising. Thus, in this Letter we explore the formation of the Θ+-baryon within a new approach called parton-based Gribov–Regge theory. It is realized in the Monte Carlo program NEXUS 3.97 [22,23]. In this model high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions are treated within a self-consistent quantum mechanical multiple scattering formalism. Elementary interactions, happening in parallel, correspond to underlying microscopic (predominantly soft) parton cascades and are described effectively as phenomenological soft pomeron exchanges. A pomeron can be seen as layers of a (soft) parton ladder, which is attached to projectile and target nucleons via leg partons. At high energies one accounts also for the contribution of perturbative (high pt) partons described by a so-called “semihard pomeron”—a piece of the QCD parton ladder sandwiched between two soft pomerons which are connected to the projectile and to the target in the usual way. The spectator partons of both projectile and target nucleons, left after pomeron emissions, form nucleon remnants. The legs of the pomerons form color singlets, such as q–q̄, q–qq or q̄–q̄q̄. The probability of q–qq and q̄–q̄q̄ is controlled by the parameter Pqq and is fixed by the experimental yields on (multi-)strange baryons [23].
