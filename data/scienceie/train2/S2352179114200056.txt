Power and particle exhaust are crucial for the viability of any future fusion power plant concept. Heat in fusion reactors must be extracted through a wall and cannot be exhausted volumetrically, which limits the allowed power density in fusion reactors [1] and is a severe technical challenge in itself [2]. In addition, structural material changes resulting from neutron irradiation cause degradation in the heat exhaust capabilities of existing designs [3] and static surfaces can suffer severely from erosion due to impinging plasma particles [4,5]. It is concluded that conventional concepts and materials for plasma facing components (PFCs) reach their limits in terms of material lifetime and power exhaust at approximately 20MW/m2, which is presumably dramatically reduced to <10MW/m2 due to neutron damage in a D-T reactor [6] or even only half that value [7].
