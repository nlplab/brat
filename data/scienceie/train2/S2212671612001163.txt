The paper deals with the computation of distribution network components reliability parameters. Knowledge of the component reliability parameters in power networks is necessary for the reliability computation and also for reliability-centered maintenance system. Component reliability parameters are possible to retrieve only with accurate databases of distribution companies. Such a database includes records of outages and interruptions in power networks. It is impossible to retrieve reliability parameters from this data in a direct way because of heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce some results of databases calculations. We apply this framework for the retrieving of parameters from outage data in the Czech and Slovak republics. There are also actual results.
