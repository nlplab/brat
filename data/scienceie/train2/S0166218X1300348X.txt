Max-linear programs have been used to describe optimisation problems for multiprocessor interactive systems. In some instances the variables used in this model are required to be integer; however, no method seems to exist for finding integer solutions to max-linear programs.For a generic class of matrices, we show that integer solutions to two-sided max-linear systems and programs can be found in polynomial time. For general matrices, we adapt the existing methods for finding real solutions to obtain algorithms for finding integer solutions.
