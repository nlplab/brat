Seismic tomography is a powerful tool to investigate the deep structure under the volcanoes. With the recently rapid development of Chinese provincial seismic networks (Zheng et al., 2009, 2010) and some portable seismic arrays (Hetland et al., 2004; Duan et al., 2009; Lei et al., 2012b) around the volcanoes, it has become possible to image the detailed 3-D velocity structure under some of these volcanoes, where seismic stations are densely spaced. In this overview, we synthesize the results from the deep seismic images of the upper mantle under the Changbaishan, Tengchong, Hainan volcanoes as well as the Datong volcano (Fig. 1). We also evaluate the advantages of recently updated seismic tomographic techniques for deriving potential information. This work updates a previous review of Zhao and Liu (2010) on this topic, with more detailed synthesis of all the available information.
