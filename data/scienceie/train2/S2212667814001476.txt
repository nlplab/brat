Security issues of data hosted in a Cloud Computing provider remain hidden seen excessive marketing that led to a totally unrealistic view of cloud computing security. Although Cloud Computing has not yet reached the level of maturity expected by its customers, and that the problems of confidentiality, integrity, reliability and consistency (CIRC) are still open, the researchers in this field have already considered a future cloud strategy which aims: a better QoS, reliability and high availability, it is the Multi-Clouds, Cloud of Clouds or Interclouds.This paper will present the security limitations in the single Cloud and the usefulness of adopting rather Multi-Clouds strategy to reduce security risks, through the use of DepSky which is a virtual storage system that ensures better availability and high confidentiality of data.
