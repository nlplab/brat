The agreement between the new data and the calculations with the relativistic deuteron wave function should not be considered as accidental one; in this connection other results should be mentioned. Previously it was shown [15] that calculations within the framework of light-front dynamics with Karmanov's deuteron wave function are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data on the T20 parameter of deuteron breakup on H and C targets with the emission of protons at 0° in the k region from 0.4 to 0.8 GeV/c. Furthermore, within the same approach a qualitative description of the momentum behaviour of the Ayy parameter of the 9Be(d,p)X reaction at a deuteron momentum of 4.5 GeV/c and a detected proton angle of 80 mr and a rather good description of the Ayy data for the 12C(d,p)X reaction at 9 GeV/c and 85 mr were obtained [16].
