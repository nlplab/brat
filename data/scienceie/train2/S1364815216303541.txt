As a particular case of survey data, we used the iUTAH “Utah Water Survey,” which was implemented by participating researchers from several Utah institutions of higher education. The objectives of the survey were to document how a representative cross-section of Utah's adult population thinks about water issues. The survey included three core blocks of questions: perceptions of the adequacy of local water supplies, perceptions of the quality of local water resources, and concern about a range of water and non-water issues. A number of additional questions captured information about respondents' familiarity with water cost, lawn-watering behaviors, participation in water based recreation, and demographic attributes. Supplementary material to this paper includes a document with a description of the dataset as a whole, a document containing the complete survey instrument, and two data files containing the results and an associated codebook (see Section 4.3).
