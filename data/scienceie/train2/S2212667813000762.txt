Analyzing the significance of macroscopical dynamic monitoring of new add construction land, considering the influence of various factors, this paper selected Yinchuan Plain for a typical experimental zone, built knowledge base of remote sensing images interpretation, used multi-temporal remote sensing images, carried through interactive interpretation of change patterns of new add construction land and field validation. Interpretation results of 20m scale remote sensing image show that the minimum spot average area of new construction land change monitored by 20m scale remote sensing data is about 6 acres. The ability 20m scale remote sensing data identifies new increased construction land change further strengthens, shows in the recognition of the smallest spot area reduces and the recognition accuracy increases.
