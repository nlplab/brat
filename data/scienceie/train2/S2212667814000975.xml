A growing amount of researchers and practitioners are  concerning about the sustainability of urban transportation system. But few people have paid close attention to  transportation system sustainability in megalopolis. It should not be neglected that megalopolis has been  regarded as the main settlement pattern[2] and crucial economic geography phenomenon[3], and  megalopolises are here to stay for the foreseeable future[4]. In the on-going globalization of economic, social  and cultural processes, megalopolises play the role of nodal points where human activities concentrate[5].   Compared with other congeneric reaches, this paper is more that of developing framework for evaluating  sustainability of transport system and the presenting its application on the comparing the two megalopolises  Jing-Jin-Ji and Yangtze River Delta.  The most advantage of the framework is that it is firmly rooted in the  regional nature of megalopolis and features of transportation demand in megalopolis and its data sources  based on the regular statistics can be reached at very low cost. And the application verified the feasibility and  the usefulness of the elaborate indicators.   2. Development of evaluating framework The objective of this chapter is to analyse structure and content of evaluating framework with which the  sustainability of transportation system in megalopolis can be quantitatively measured. And the evaluating  framework is supposed to be endowed with the following attributes: a) systematic set of measurable indicators  which firmly rooted in the nature of sustainability and that of transportation system in megalopolis; b) and  data sources which are detailed enough to carry out the analysis and can be found in other megalopolis to  establish comparisons.  The fundamental role of transport system is to facilitate mobility. But too much attention and effort have  been paid on enhancing operating speed. A perspective of sustainability has shifted the emphasis from   seeking higher operating speed to seeking more comprehensive goals across economic, social and  environmental dimensions[6]. Now several frameworks or indicator system can be found in existing  literatures for measuring sustainability in transportation system or in a certain regional level, but no standard  one exists and unlikely appears due to the disagreement on the definition of sustainability and the various  purposes of establishing a framework. The frameworks found in the literatures can be placed into three  categories: 1) linkages-based frameworks, 2) impacts-based frameworks and 3) influence-oriented  frameworks[7]. According to this classification, the framework proposed in this paper belongs to the second  type which focus on the nature and extent of various kinds of impacts (e.g., economic, environmental, social)  that collectively determine the sustainability of a system. Fig. 1 the interrelation among transportation and the three dimensions of sustainability  112   Lingli Wang /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  110 â€“ 116  Economic, environmental and social dimensions are regarded as the triple-bottom-line principle of  sustainability, and the interrelation among transportation and the three dimensions can be interpreted as what  are shown in Fig.1. The basic nature of transportation is to fulfill the mobility of passengers and goods, and  the first primary factor of transportation is its capacity. Transport capacity firstly manifests as the amount of  vehicles, the length of transport lines and so on. The second primary factor is service quality like connectivity,  accessibility, as well as fare. The interdependence between transportation and economic state is undeniable  and requires no more explanation. With the ever-increasing traffic volume, the negative impacts of  transportation on environment loom larger and larger in nowadays and environment in its turn is restricting  the development of transportation in available land and energy. However, transportation sector is facing with  more and more intractable demand from the society, while various efforts have been undertaken to improve  the harmony between transportation and social dimension.   Based on the above illumination, we propose a framework as follows.  1) Environmental dimension  In the indicators proposed by [9], the three indicators arable land, CO 2  emissions, and commercial energy  use are adopted to reflect the environmental dimension of sustainable transport. But EEA [10] has pointed out  that Nitrogen Oxides are the major air polluting problem and is much more harmful that CO 2 , so we adopted  Nitrogen Oxides emission instead of CO 2  emission to depict the impact of trans port on air quality. Transport  noise is an increasing issue affecting more and more urban inhabitants. Prolonged noise exposure can impact  on amenity values and health in some circumstances; therefore it is necessary to take the indicator of transport  noise into the consideration. 2) Social dimension  A sustainable transport system should be in favor of fostering health and well-being in the community at  present and in the future. However social concerns are more abstract then other aspects so that it is more  difficult to measure the social performance of transport system. Hereby to capture the critical issues of social  dimension, safety &amp; security and adaption are chosen as the social factors. And we suggest using traffic  accident amount along with traffic accident loss to denote the frequency and severity, and using the ratio of  motor car to population to denote the social adaption of transport system.  3) Economic dimension  Though there are plenty of economic indicators of relating to the sustainability of transport sector, two  categories can be roughly seen, individual ones and the communal ones. For individual economic aspect, the  percentage of traffic expenditure to total expenditure in daily life is quite visualized and easily measured by  statistical data. For communal one, the input and output value are the fundamental factors and also easily to be  measured in an utter objective way.  4) Mobility  A lot of mobility indicators systems have been proposed by European and other international institutions  by adopting a multidimensional approach that takes into account multiple impacts of transport activities[8],  for instance, PROPOLIS. To capture the essential of mobility and avoid unnecessary overlap with other  dimensions, the two factors of connectivity and coverage rate are selected. Lengths of railways and highways  are used to represent the former one and the transport network density (the ratio of total length of railway and  highways weighted by their average transport capacity to the area of studied region) is used to represent the  latter one. The coverage rate is computed by Eq.(1)  cTL                                                                 (1)  where c is the coverage rate, T the total converted turnover in ton-kilometer, and L the total mileage in  service. The data of T and L can be found easily in the yearly statistical bulletin of the Ministry of Transport.  Besides, passenger turnover in unit area is adopted to denote the congestion degree.  113 Lingli Wang  /  IERI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  110 â€“ 116  The sustainability of transportation covers several different aspects of value judgments relating to  transportation technology, sociology, economy, and environment protect. Therefore, it is very impossible to  get any straightforward solution but a compromise one. Performance evaluation of transport system requires  an adequate evaluation methodology that can provides a comprehensive benchmark. Multicriteria evaluation  is particularly well suited for this purpose, for it allows for a flexible way to deal with multidimensional  factors so that can be used to dissect a single dimension as well as a holistic system. Multicriteria evaluation  have been effectively applied to the relative studies[11, 12]. A detailed discussion of the process of  multicriteria evaluation is beyond the confine this paper. Readers are instead referred to the monograph [13].

Basic information of Jing-Jin-Ji and Yangtze River Delta megalopolises  Today Jing-Jin-Ji, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta, have been regarded as the top developed   megalopolises in china[14]. Jing-Jin-Ji megalopolis, including Beijing, Tianjin, and eight cities in Hebei  province, is acting as the political and cultural center of China, and  the primary industrial core of northern  China.[15]. Yangtze River Delta megalopolis, centralized by Shanghai and composed of 13 cities in Jiangsu  province, 11 cities in Zhejiang province and 5 cities in Anhui province, is the most prosperous and urbanized  region in China. Its economic aggregate is more and more exceeding that of Jing-Jin-Ji and Jing-Jin-Ji is the  worst one of the three according to a study of comprehensive development environment. Since sustainable  transportation is the cornerstone of development, we will apply the indicators and framework proposed hereby  to dissect the gap of sustainability in the transport systems in the two regions aiming to facilitate finding the  way of catching up for the laggard.  To give intuitive comparisons for the indicators with different units, all the data of various indicators have  been processed by the standardization that all the data of Jing-Jin-Ji megalopolis are converted into 1 and the  114   Lingli Wang /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  110 â€“ 116  corresponding data of Yangtze River Delta are converted into a percentage, so that different indicators of one  goal are contrasted in the same chart.  4. Comparison and analysis on Jing-Jin-Ji and Yangtze River Delta  As is shown in Fig.2, the petroleum consumption in Jing-Jin-Ji is less than 0.55% of that in Yangtze River  Delta, and the land use for transportation in Jing-Jin-Ji is 67% of that in Yangtze River Delta, which suggests  that Jing-Jin-Ji is practising much more efficient resource utilization in transportation while the public  transportation service volume is 1.5 times greater than that in Yangtze River Delta (See the Fig.3). But So far  neither air pollution state nor noise pollution state in Jing-Jin-Ji can engender optimism due to the  superabundant total amount of motor vehicles.  Traffic accident abatement is an endless plea for transportation sector. In contrast with Yangtze River  Delta, Jing-Jin-Ji is apparently operating transportation system with more safety hazard. The amount and loss  of traffic accident in Jing-Jin-Ji have been up to about 1.8 times and 1.45 times of those in Yangtze River  Delta respectively (as shown in Fig.3). Safety and security is a vital aspect in the process of constructing  Fig. 2 Comparison of environmental factors  Fig.3 Comparison of social factors  Fig.4 Comparison of economic factors   Fig.5 Comparison of mobility factors   115 Lingli Wang  /  IERI Procedia   9  ( 2014 )  110 â€“ 116  sustainable transportation system in any regional scale and the striking contrasting result should rouse  effective rectification.  Economic growth requires a quick and efficient transport system, at the same time transport activity is also  good part of economic sector. The inhabitants in Jing-Jin-Ji pay a little more fraction of the total expenditure  than those in Yangtze River Delta, but the transportation system in Jing-Jin-Ji produces less 77% than that in  Yangtze River Delta. In other words, the people in Jing-Jin-Ji benefit from the immense financial investment  and subsidy, which is manifested by the second set of bars in Fig.3.  The essential nature of transportation is acting as a provider of mobility service. In term of transport  capacity, the total turnover of passenger traffic in Jing-Jin-Ji is only 60% of that in Yangtze River Delta (as  shown in Fig.4) and the immediate cause is the comparative lack of highways which lead to a rather less  dense transportation network. Consequently, people in Jing-Jin-Ji are suffering more serious congestion in a  little higher possibility.  5. Summary and conclusions  From the preceding sector, the following conclusions can be reached:  Firstly, comparing with Yangtze River Delta, Jing-Jin-Ji demonstrates its superiority in resource  conversation which mainly benefits form the huge pubic rail transit system, but a large number of the private  cars cause the undesirable environment characterized by the excessive air pollution and noise. All this is  urging to optimize the structure of transport system in the megalopolis by means of limiting the ownership of  private car and encouraging green car.  Secondly, the shocking traffic accident figures of both Jing-Jin-Ji and Yangtze River Delta are against their  social effects. On the end of transport sector, especially for that of Jing-Jing-Ji, the matter of great account is  to intensify the traffic management system and to improve the relating technical measures. A smooth  multilateral coordination base on advanced information technology is an imperative to build more powerful  system of accident prevention and major accident rescue system.  Thirdly, the transport system in Jing-Jin-Ji rides on the immense financial support from the government,  and the inferior economic effect is calling for more various ways of fund-raising to realize a rational and long- lasting economic circumstance. Now there are some optimistic signs such as the market-based financing and  fare adjustment of urban rail transit.  The last but not the least, the fact that the total amount of transport service is insufficient is confirmed by  the above quantitative analysis results of less transport network density and worse state of congestion, therefor,  higher coverage rate of transport network and improve public transport service are in need for the areas  around Beijing, like majority areas of Hebei province. Above all, any single large city is not powerful enough  to build a prosperous megalopolis, but only dynamic equilibrium within different parts of the megalopolis will  lead to integrating development of the megalopolis.  The application on Jing-Jin-Ji and Yangtze River Delta have shown that the framework is fit to capture the  particular qualities of megalopolis and then to analysis and compare kindred megalopolises with readily  accessible data source. After all for a megalopolis, the main difference from a large city is the  administration partitioning between different provinces and the barrier between urban area and suburb area.  The framework provides a way to come across the obstacles to dissect several megalopolises under the  universal benchmark, so that facilitate exploring the root cause of something unpleasant and devise adequate  countermeasures. To avoid the influence of natural conditions, those factors relating to water transport havenâ€™t  been taken into consideration. Due to limited space, the integrated analysis using multicriteria evaluation  cannot be presented.  116   Lingli Wang /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  110 â€“ 116  The main limitation of this framework is the lack of indicators of social equity brought by transport system.  Equity is one of the most important factors but it is the most difficult one to be quantified and addressed.  Although we have treated equity as an integrated part of principle of sustainability and represented it in other  indicators, like density of network, and ratio of traffic expenditure, elaborate approach of measuring the  equity is a very intriguing project in the future research.

Thereupon, the new emphases on sustainability of transportation system in megalopolis are creating new demands for adequate approach to measure its performance and diagnosis potential drawbacks. By examining the descriptions of sustainable transport system as well as its evaluating approach, a framework with the general applicability and easily accessible data resource for evaluating sustainability of transport system in megalopolis is developed based on nature of regional structure and the feature transport demand in megalopolis.
