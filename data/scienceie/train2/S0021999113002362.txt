The algorithm allows the modelling of plasmas of arbitrary degeneracy under the binary collision approximation. It uses a numerical interpolation of the inverse cumulative density function of the Fermi–Dirac distribution to initialise simulation particles, and collisions are subject to Pauli blocking. It is not appropriate in the limit of very strong coupling because the plasma theory which the Monte Carlo code is based on breaks down. The strong coupling limit corresponds to lnΛ≲3, with lnΛ the Coulomb logarithm [10]. The code is designed for lnΛ>3 in collisional plasmas with a non-negligible level of degeneracy. It is noted that Monte Carlo techniques with degenerate capabilities have been developed for studying transport in semi-conductors [11] but no such method exists for fully-ionised plasmas. Some of the techniques described are potentially applicable to other types of codes, for example, Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes.
