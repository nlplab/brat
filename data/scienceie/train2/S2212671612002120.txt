A design method for network attack and defense simulation platform is discussed in this paper. Firstly the component and function of the platform are analyzed. Then Visio second development method is used to construct the virtual network topology. The parsing of virtual network topology is also researched and the relative flow sheet is described. Lastly an example is carried out to test performance of the platform. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
