We analyze the diagonal and transition magnetic and electric dipole moments of charged leptons in extended technicolor (ETC) models, taking account of the multiscale nature of the ETC gauge symmetry breaking, conformal (walking) behavior of the technicolor theory, and mixing in the charged-lepton mass matrix. We show that mixing effects dominate the ETC contributions to charged lepton electric dipole moments and that these can yield a value of |de| comparable to the current limit. The rate for μ→eγ can also be close to its limit. From these and other processes we derive constraints on the charged lepton mixing angles. The constraints are such that the ETC contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, which includes a significant lepton mixing term, can approach, but does not exceed, the current sensitivity level.
