In this paper, adaptive beamforming techniques for smart antennas based upon Least Mean Squares (LMS), Sample Matrix Inversion (SMI), Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM) are discussed and analyzed. The beamforming performance is studied by varying the element spacing and the number of antenna array elements for each algorithm. These four algorithms are compared for their rate of convergence, beamforming and null steering performance (beamwidth, null depths and maximum side lobe level).
