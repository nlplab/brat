Unlike conventional materials used in nerve tissue engineering, PAs can be directly injected in vivo into models and spontaneously self-assemble into nanofibers in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, PAs can function as biomimetic materials exemplified by collagen-mimetic PAs [92]. Conventional materials often rely on electrospinning as a manufacturing method to achieve fiber-like structures suitable for use in nerve regeneration. The self-assembly nature of PAs allows them to circumvent costly manufacturing methods. However, in contrast to conventional manufacturing methods like electrospinning where quality and batch-to-batch variability can be tightly controlled, merely relying on self-assembly as a method of large-scale commercial production is still an experimental concept. Perhaps the next step would be to carefully compare and contrast the robustness of self-assemled PAs to electrospun nanofibers. Given that the constituent elements in PAs and external factors like pH can affect its structural assembly, parameters must be finely tuned and optimized in order for PA nanofibers to be used as a full-fledged commercialized medical product [93].
