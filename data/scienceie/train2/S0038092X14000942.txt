Thermal performance of the smart window has been predicted under different simulated parameters namely, direct solar radiation intensity, ambient temperature, water inlet temperature, and water flow rate. Fig. 11 shows a sample of temperature distribution of all window components at a plane passing through the horizontal window segment based on simulation physical conditions listed on Table 3. Simulation data has been collected from all successive simulations. The effect of increasing direct solar radiation on both solar cells and water temperatures is shown in Fig. 12. Three different simulations were performed assuming direct solar radiation intensities of 400, 600, and 800W/m2 incident on the window’s front pane with set ambient temperature, water inlet temperature and water flow rate of respectively 273K, 283K and 0.01kg/s. Water temperature was found to increase by 5°C as it passed through the tube, carrying the solar cells, from left to right for the bottom most units at 800W/m2 of direct incident solar radiation.
