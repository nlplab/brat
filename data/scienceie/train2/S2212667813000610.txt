The most important goal of the software industry is to produce successful product. During the process of production several times the product fails due to lack of proper management. This paper is exploring the role of software engineering courses in computer engineering related branches and then reasons why software developers lack project management in proper software management trainings. Our findings reflect that in majority of computer related branches like computer science, computer engineering, information system engineering there is no place for software project management course. Our findings are based on a survey of course curriculums of computer engineering, computer science and information system engineering courses taught in Turkish universities.
