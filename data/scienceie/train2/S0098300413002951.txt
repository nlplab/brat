Hitherto, the investigation of fossil-orientation was only used for the topmost surface of fossil mass occurrences, deposited directly on the sea floor. Due to the fast development of virtual methods (e.g., macro-CT, µ-CT, nano-CT, etc.) it became possible, to investigate the interior orientation of such fossil mass occurrences in three-dimensional detail. Although, a series of paleontological studies deal with 3D-visualization of fossil-elements, no mass occurrence has previously been reconstructed three dimensionally for investigating their interior orientation. This study illustrates an interdisciplinary approach of virtual reconstruction, analyses and interpretation of the interior orientation of an ammonoid mass occurrence. The method established herein produces clear and consistent results using planispirally coiled ammonoid shells – fossils, that so far would have been used only with caution for depositional interpretations. This method can be applied to any kind of fossil mass occurrence, or even other abundant organic elements and particles, to examine their orientation and depositional conditions to conclude on their paleoenvironment, particularly on paleocurrents.
