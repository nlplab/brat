Our country is rich of line galloping, there are many important galloping data failed to collect systematically and completely because there is no unified management platform. After the galloping occurrence in 2009–2010's winter the department of productive of the State Grid Corporation organized a lot of human to carry out the research of galloping information, this work is time–consuming and inefficient. The State Grid Corporation has used the production management system (PMS) which is a powerful and easy to use. With the help of the system we can create a galloping database which can save resources and storage the galloping data. To build and put it into application of database can provide technical support for line galloping prevention and galloping research work.
