In order to solve the problem that the diesel engine PT fuel system is unable to field maintain, developed a portable signal acquisition and analysis system for diesel engine PT fuel system. Firstly, the PT pump work Principle was analyzed, and the PT pump failure mapping relation between reason and failure phenomenon was analyzed; Secondly, the diesel engine PT pump failure fuel pressure characteristics were analyzed; Lastly, using the portable signal acquisition and analysis system to diagnose the diesel engine PT fuel system, experiment results show that the system can correctly detect the diesel engine PT fuel system state.
