Introduction   The GO methodology is an available method of system reliability analysis. Different with some other  modeling method, such as static FTA, it is a success-oriented one and mainly be used to solve the problem of  systems with multiple states and time-sequential signals. This method was first introduced from Kaman  Science Company of USA in the middle of 1960s, and had been used to analyze the safety and reliability of  weapon system. In the early 1980s, Go methodology had got the further improvement and development.    *  Yong Chen Tel:+86-13811667174  Email:chenbhu@gmail.com    Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  2012 The Authors.

In the early 1980s, Institute for Standardization of Nuclear Industry first introduced GO methodology in  China. In recent years, GO methodology has developed rapidly in theory and practical method, such as the  probability accumulation algorithm and probability quantitative analysis method with common cause failures.  By far, GO methodology has been used to analyze or assess the reliability of many practical engineering  systems, such as nuclear power plant power system, natural gas pipes system and aviation electronic  equipment. Although GO methodology has many advantages, the existing algorithm is theoretical, and hard to  solve with computer, which makes it difficult to apply and popularize in complex engineering systems.  Therefore, the GO methodology for computer solving becomes the bottle neck to generalize the method [2].  In this paper, a new algorithm is provided. First, the GO chart is transformed into series structure. Based on  the minimal path sets. Last, it can directly deduce the minimal path sets and calculate the value of system  reliability. It will simplify the programming and decrease the computational consumption.  2. Algorithm of GO Methodology  Zhupei Shen had presented two algorithms of GO methodology [2].  compute the signal state probability, then using combination and simplification to obtain minimum path sets  and cut sets. However, if the number of operators rises, the number of state combination will explode.  The other is Probability Accumulation algorithm, which can be used to compute the state probability of the  oreover, the algorithm  can get the minimal cuts of the two-state system with quantificational computing [5].  2.1. Path Sets and Minimal Path Sets.   The system reliability may also be determined using minimal path sets. A path is a set of components  whose functioning ensures that the system functions. A minimal path is one in which all the components  within the set must function for the system to function [6].  2.2. GO Chart Processing  GO methodology has defined seventeen kinds of operators, denoted with the type of 1-17. In the GO  methodology, every operator represent a specific component, the signal-flows represent connections between  the operators. The operators represent specific function and the input and output signals have to obey the  operation rules.   Although GO methodology owns seventeen kinds of operators, only ten of them are usually used. We  denote them by set A, A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11} , the type 2, 10  and 11 operators are logical operators and they represent logical relation of multiple input signals, others are  functional operators. The logical so  the logical operators are not included in the minimal path set.  From the set of function operator, type 6, 7 and 8 operators have two input signals, when we deduce the  minimal path sets by Enumeration method, first, put the second input signal in series with the main input  signal. Then, delete the same operators between second input signal and main input signal. Then, getting a  new chart where type 6, 7 and 8 operators have only one input signal. From Figure 1, we know type 1, 3, and  5 operators have only one input signal. These be possessed.  370   Yong Chen et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  368 â€“ 374    In the set of logical operator, these three kinds of operator only represent the logical relationship among the  signals. Generally, each logical operator has at least two or more than two input signals. When deduce the  minimal path sets, we need processing the logical operators. If GO chart include the type 2 operator, according  to the property of OR gate, add the operator OR gate and the operators after OR gate to N signals before OR  gate. If GO chart include the type 10 operator, let N signals before AND gate become one signal, after it delete  the same operators in these N signals. If GO chart include the type 11 operator, let the operators which  connect with the K-out-of-M gate become in series with each other by K operator, So we have  . 0 &amp;  kinds of  combination, and support the operators  forward of these  . 0 &amp;  kinds combination.  If a signal is connected to two or more operators as the input signal (or one operator have two or more than  two output signals), then this signal is defined as a shared signal. When GO chart has a shared signal, copy all  the operators behind this operator onto the shared signals.  2.3. Solve the Reliability Model with Minimal Path Sets  Use all the minimal path sets: 123 ,,,, n AAA A which are deduced by new series model of GO chart of  the system. In case the system is on the successful state, only if exist at least one minimal path set. Supposed  that S denotes the event of the system normal working, then:  n i i AS 1= =   The i th minimal path set exists, meaning that every operator in this minimal path set is successful,  ij x   represents the j th factor in the set i . Then:  iy Ax iji xA =   Construct the reliability mathematical model of the system with the probability equation of mutually  inclusive events. The model is:  )()1(++)(+)()(=)(=)(= 1= 1 2=&lt;2&lt;&lt;1= 1= n i i n n ji n kji kjiji n i i n i is APAAAPAAPAPAPSPR          3. Case Study  3.1. System Definition  Water supply system as example has two states: the success and the failure. This system has one water  source and two waterways, each way includes an electric pump, a check valve and two control valves which  are in parallel and always closed. So every waterway has two water supply export, and the system have four  water supply export. Electric pump on each waterway has its own power. Only the power state is success, the  pump can work, two control valves in each waterway are controlled by own control signal. Only the control  signal is success, the control valve can open. The successful state is that at least two water supply export  successful. Figure 1 shows the water supply system principle diagram.  371 Yong Chen et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  368 â€“ 374    Water  source Pump  A Pump  B         Power A Power B Check  Valve A Check  Valve B Drive  Signal A Drive  Signal A Drive  Signal B Drive  Signal B Control  Valve A1 Control  Valve A2 Control  Valve B2   Figure 1 water supply system principle diagram  3.2. Establishing Reliability Model with GO Methodology  The GO methodology Model is easy established based on water supply system functional diagram. First,  according to the function of water supply system components, corresponding type of operators represent  specific components. For example, water source is the input of the system, which is represented by type 5  operator. Similarly, powers and drive signals are also represented by type 5 operator. The electric pump needs  the control signal to operator normally, which is represented by type 6 operator. Here, the primary input signal  is from water source, and the secondary control signal is the output of the power. Similarly, control valves  must operate upon receiving the control signals, which are also represented by type 6 operator. The check  valves are two states components, which we use operator 1.  For water supply system, at least two water supply export are successful, then the water supply is  successful, this logical relationship is represented by type 11 operator. Figure 2 shows the GO chart of this  water supply system.  5 - 1 6-3 6-9 1-4 1-10 5 - 5 5 - 1 1 5-8 5-2 6-6 6-7 6-12 6-13 11-14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13   Figure 2 GO chart of water supply system  372   Yong Chen et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  368 â€“ 374    The first number in the operators of the GO chart represents the type of operators, the second number  represents the numbering of operators, and the numbers on the signal line mean the numbering of signals.  The input of the system consists of the water power, the power and the drive signal sources, which are  represented by Type 5 operator, the check valves are represented by Type 1 operator. The electric pumps and  control valves are represented by Type 6 operator.  3.3. Deducing the Minimal Path Sets on Go Chart  From Figure 2, the system starts from operator 5-1, ends with operator 11-14. This Go chart is too complex  to deduce the minimal path sets directly, it should be dealt with, form the last operator to the first one. First,  operator 11-14 is a 2-out-of-4 gate, let the four operators which connect with operator 11-14 in series by two,  so there are  2 4 C kinds of combination, and the 6 kinds of combination are 6-6 and 6-7,6-6 and 6-12,6-6 and 6- 13,6-12 and 6-13,6-7 and 6-12,6-7 and 6-13.   Next, from Figure 2, the operator 6-7 connect with operator 11-14, then find the operator which is the input  of operator 6-7 based on GO chart. According to the figure 2, find that operator 5-5 and 1-4 are all connected  with operator 6-7. Similarly, operator 5-5 and 1-4 are the input of operator 6-6, and in Figure 2, operator 6-6 is  connected with operator 6-7. Operator 5- Operator 6-3 is connected with operator 6-6 and behind operator 6-6, we find operator 6-3 has two input signal  5-1 and 5-2. Figure 3 is the one of the minimal path of the water supply system.  5 - 2 6-3 5 - 1 5 - 5 1-4 6-6 6-7 11-14   Figure 3 the first minimal path  Similarly, we deduce the rest of 5 kinds of combination.

According to  logical relationship of the operators in GO chart, we transform GO chart into series model, then get the  minimal path sets based on enumeration method from first operator to last one. This new algorithm is suitable  for computer aided solving. The application of the case indicates the method can be used in practical  engineering, which can efficiently deal with the quantitative analysis of complex GO methodology models.

Next, from Figure 2, the operator 6-7 connect with operator 11-14, then find the operator which is the input  of operator 6-7 based on GO chart. According to the figure 2, find that operator 5-5 and 1-4 are all connected  with operator 6-7. Similarly, operator 5-5 and 1-4 are the input of operator 6-6, and in Figure 2, operator 6-6 is  connected with operator 6-7. Operator 5- Operator 6-3 is connected with operator 6-6 and behind operator 6-6, we find operator 6-3 has two input signal  5-1 and 5-2.

In this paper, we research a new method to get the reliability of system based on GO methodology. According to some properties of the operators in GO chart, GO chart can be transformed into series structure, then the minimal path sets are induced based on Enumeration method from first operator to last one. It is very convenient for computer to calculate the system reliability with the new method based on minimal path sets.
