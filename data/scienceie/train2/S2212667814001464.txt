Recently, a network virtualization technology has attracted considerable attention as one of new generation network technologies. In this paper, in order to permit the rapid changing for a topology of a virtual network, we propose a new virtual network construction method based on the shortest path betweenness. In our proposed method, at first, a service provider receives a user's request for the reconfiguration of the constructed virtual network. In this case, the service provider reconfigures the topology of the constructed virtual network rapidly based on shortest path betweenness. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method with simulation, and we show the effectiveness of our proposed method.
