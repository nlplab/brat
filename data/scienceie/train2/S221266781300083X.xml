Introduction  Agricultural products are the necessities of human life and rigid consumer goods, and it is one of the most  important social producing. Since the human society entered the modern time, agricultural production has  become an industry with more detailed labor division, and most consumers do not need to produce agricultur- al products, which make production supply and consumption of agricultural products a supply chain. With the  developing of supply chain management theory, many companies like IBM, P&amp;G, DELL succeeded in apply- ing supply chain management into bassness, and the agricultural product industry also have applied the    supply chain management theory to improve their own competitiveness. In developed countries, Agricul- tural product supply chain has been widely practice, and become a hot topic in academic research.  Kazaz, 2004 consider the random yield characteristics in the process of agricultural production, production  planning and pricing decision problem under the background of random output. Deo, 2009 focuses on  the  influenza vaccine market of United States, studies the problem of stochastic output with  Cournot competition  model, and found that random yield incentive the industry tend to become gathering, and reduce the produc- tion plan, which damage consumer welfare.  Bohle Maturana and Vera, 2010 focus on wine grape harvesting scheduling optimization problem subject  to  yield uncertainty. The research shows how effective robust optimization is solving this problem in practice  and develop alternative robust models and show results for some test problems obtained from actual wine  industry problems. Boyabatli, Kleindorfer and Koontz, 2011 analyzes the optimal procurement, processing,  and production decisions of a meat-processing company in a beef supply chain subject to  yield uncertainty,  and the research show that higher variability of  product  increases the profits of the packer, but decreases the  reliance on the contract market relative to the spot market.  He, 2010 study the optimization problems of production and procurement in a decentralized supply chain  consisting of one supplier and one manufacturer, and the study shows that the supplier's profit function is  piece-wise concave and explore structural properties for the manufacturer. He and Zhao, 2011 study the in- ventory, production, and contracting decisions of a multi-echelon supply chain with both demand and supply  uncertainty, and find that the commonly used wholesale price contracts used by both up-stream and down- stream supply-chain members cannot coordinate the system, and further provide contract terms that lead to  winâ€“win situation. The study also investigate the impact of the supplier's risk attitude on the decisions, as well  as the impact of spot market price for raw material on the performance of the entire supply chain.  In this paper, we consider the coordination problem of agricultural products supply chain with stochastic  output studies based on prices compensation strategy. Since the above study show the agricultural product  supplier tend to reduce the production plan when it face the risk of yield uncertainty. We introduce the prices  compensation strategy, which is that the retailer rise the procurement price higher than wholesale market price.  We model the agricultural products supply chain with stochastic output, and prove prices compensation strat- egy is Pareto improvement.  2. Model Assumptions  In this paper, the agricultural product supply chain consist of one supplier  and one retailer  with two type  of market, which are the wholesale market and the consumer market. The retailer could purchase agricultural  products in wholesale market or make procurement contract with supplier directly. If the supplier has no con- tract with retailer, they would sale their agricultural products in wholesale market and the retailer buy the  products in wholesale price. Since we focus on price compensation strategy, the contract of retailer and sup- plier with price compensation would be simplify as the compensation on wholesale price per product.  120   Guoping Nong and Sulin Pang /  IERI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  118 â€“ 125  Under the consideration that the agricultural products are perishable goods, we assume the consumer mar- ket is market clear in order to ignore buy-back contract and simplify calculation. The notation of variables are  defined as following:  x  Supplier Agricultural products plan   H P Wholesale prices;  M P : Consumer market price ;  Q : Price compensation;  P R : Coefficient of stochastic yield, which is random variables of mean 1 and variance , and 1 ;  The retail price and wholesale price of agricultural product are functions of the quantity of product, price  function of demand in consumer markets is: () MMM Px a bx, where  M a is the passable highest con- sumer price,  M b is the influence coefficient of quantity of supplier product; similarly, the price function of  demand in wholesale markets is: () HHH Px a bx,where  H a is the passable highest wholesale price,  H b is the influence coefficient of quantity of supplier product. For the sake of simplicity, we assume the  pro- curement  price of retailer and the selling price of supplier are identical.  Remark:  M H aa, the retail price is larger than the wholesale price,;  1 MH aa , since the scale of measurement, difference of  retail price and wholesale price could always  set larger than 1;  ()() MH H aa aC, retail profit is greater than production profit;  H M bb, due to the supplier is far away from the consumer market, quantity of supplier product is less in- fluence on the retail price is less than the coefficient on consumer  market price than wholesale price.  3. The optimal strategies of retailer and supplier  In this paper, we consider two kind structures of the supply chains: 1, suppliers sell product in the whole- sale market, and retailer buy products from wholesale market and sell to consumer  in consumer  market price,  there are no cooperation between supplier and retailer; 2, retailers and suppliers make a price compensation  contract, the retailer compensate suppliers for every product; the supplier make producing plan according to  price compensation, retailers would buy the product of supplier with price compensation, then sell to consum- er in  the consumer price.  3.1. Supply chain without cooperation   The supplier's production plan is set according to the price function of demand in the wholesale market,  and its expectation profit is;  22 2 () ( ( ) ) ( ) ( ) ()(1) SpHHp HpHP HH F x ExR a bxR xC EaxR EbxR Cx aCxb x   The maximum expectation profit:  2 (() (( ( ) ) (( ) ( 1) ) SpHp HH Max F x Max E xR a b xR xC Max a C x b x   121 Guoping Nong and Sulin Pang /  IERI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  118 â€“ 125  It is easy to see that () S Fx  is convex function, because of   2 () 2 ( 1) 0 SH dF x b   Hence there is optimal solution of () S Fx, by the first order condition of optimization:  2( 1) S H Max H aC x b   So the maximum expectation profit of supplier is :    2 () 4( 1) S H Max H aC F b   Similarly, the maximum expectation profit of retailer could be obtained as following:  2 () ( ( ) ()()(1) RpMMpHHp MH HM Fx ExRa bxR a bxR aaxbb x   The maximum expectation profit of retailer:  2 (() (( ) ( )( 1) ) R MH HM Max F x Max a a x b b x   It is easy to see that () R Fx  is convex function, because of   2 () 2( )( 1) 0 RHM dF x b b   Hence there is optimal solution of () R Fx, by the first order condition of optimization:  2( )( 1) R MH Max HM aa x bb   The maximum expectation profit of retailer:  2 () 4( )( 1) R MH Max HM aa F bb   Proposition 1: In the agricultural products supply chain without cooperation, the retailer's optimal order  quantity is larger than the optimal production plan of supplier's.  122   Guoping Nong and Sulin Pang /  IERI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  118 â€“ 125  Proof: by the assumptions of ()() MH H aa aCand  HM bb, we get ()0 HHM bbb . The  numerator of optimal retailer order is larger than the supplierâ€™s, and the denominator is smaller, it is not diffi- cult to see that  RS Max Max x x , QED.  Remark: Since the retailer's optimal order quantity is larger than the supplierâ€™s, the retailer profit is not  maximized, consumer market is in unsaturated state. The raise of the purchase price of retailer would motives  the product plan of supplier, then improve supply chain profit. Since the supplier's production plan is made  before the selling season in supply chain without influence of retailer, the expect profits of retailer is shown as  following:    2 ()( ) ( )(1)( ) 2( 1) 2( 1) RS HH Max M H H M aC aC Fx a a b b bb   3.2. Supply chain with cooperation   In order to encourage supplier to expand production plan, the retailer compensate on wholesale price of  supplier. Then, the supplier make production plan according to the wholesale market wholesale price and  compensation price,  so the supplier's expected profit is present as following;  2 (, ) ( ( ) ) ()(1) C SpHp H F x Q E xR a b xR Q xC aQCxb x   The maximum expectation profit of supplier:  2 (() (( ( ) ) (( ) ( 1) ) C SpHpp H Max F x Max E xR a b xR Q xR C Max a C Q x b x   It is easy to see that () C S Fx  is convex function, because of   2 () 2 ( 1) 0 C SH dF x b   Hence there is optimal solution of () C S Fx, by the first order condition of optimization:  () () 2( 1) CS H Max H aCQ xQ b   So the maximum expectation profit of supplier is :   2 () 4( )( 1) CS H Max HM aCQ F bb   123 Guoping Nong and Sulin Pang /  IERI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  118 â€“ 125  From the above calculation, it is not difficult to see that the optimal production plan supplier is a function  of price compensation, so retailer set price compensation to maximize their expected profit. The retailer ex- pected profit is so a function of price compensation as shown following;  2 (, ) ( ( ), ) () ()(1)( ) 2( 1) 2( 1) 2( 1) CCS RRMax HHH MH MH FxQ Fx QQ aCQ aCQ aCQ aa bb Q bbb   The maximum expectation profit of retailer:  2 (() (( ) ( )( 1)( ) 2( 1) 2( 1) 2( 1) C R HHH MH MH Max F Q aCQ aCQ aCQ Max a a b b Q bbb   It is easy to see that () C R Fx is convex function, because of  the second order condition is:  2 2 1 () (2 ( 1) 2( )( 1)( ) 0 2( 1) C RH MH H dF Q b b b b   Hence there is optimal solution of () C R Fx, by the first order condition of optimization:  ()(2)() R MHH M HH Max MH aab b baC Q bb   The maximum expectation profit of retailer is shown as following:  2 () 4( )( 1) CR MH Max HM aa F bb   Proposition 2: In the agricultural products supply chain with cooperation, retailer incentive the product plan  of supplier by price compensation, the expected profit of supplier and retailer are increase,  thus the price  compensation strategy is a Pareto improvement in supply chain.  Proof: Supplier's expected revenue, through subsidies, molecular becomes larger, the denominator becomes  small, apparently, The numerator of optimal expected profit of supplier in cooperation supply chain is larger  than the one without cooperation, and the denominator is smaller, it is apparent that  CS S Max Max FF.  Similarly,   the numerator of optimal expected profit of supplier in cooperation supply chain is larger than the one without  cooperation, and the denominator is smaller, it is apparent that  CR R Max Max FF. So the price compensation  strategy is a Pareto improvement in supply chain, QED.  Remark: By applying the price compensation strategy, the retailer share profit of the consumer market, which  is bigger than the wholesale market to supplier and incentives the products plan, then chang the production  supply, and improve the expected profits both of supplier and retailer.  124   Guoping Nong and Sulin Pang /  IERI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  118 â€“ 125  4. Numerical Experiment  In this paper, numerical experiments apply the data based on banana market of Hainan province of China   based. By the aid of Matlab7, optimal compensation price and optimal expected profit of retailer and supplier  in both non-cooperation and cooperation supply chain are calculated, and the sensitive of coefficient of sto- chastic yield  in supply chain is examined. The data used are shown as following:  2000 M a : the possible highest price of banana consumer market, RMB per ton;  0.01 M b : coefficient of banana yield influence on the consumer market;  1100 H a : the possible highest price of banana  wholesale market,RMB per ton;  0.015 H b : coefficient of banana  yield influence on the wholesale market;  1.5 : variance of coefficient of stochastic yield;  500C : production cost of  banana, RMB per ton;   Table 1.  supply chains performance under difference variances of coefficient of stochastic yield  variance of stochastic yield coefficient 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.8 2.5  non-cooperation supplier produce plan (ton) 9090 8695 8333 7142 5143  non-cooperation supplier expected profit (RMB) 2727300 2608700  2500000  2142900  1714300   non-cooperation retailer expected profit (RMB) 8181800 7826100  7500000  6428600  5142900   Price compensation (RMB per ton) 136.36  130.43  125.00 107.14 85.71  cooperation supplier produce plan (ton) 24793 23629 22569 22569 22569  cooperation supplier expected profit (RMB) 12323000 11599000 10951000 8929500 6717200  cooperation retailer expected profit (RMB) 18409000 17609000 16875000 14464000 11571000  From table 1, we can see:  1, under any variances condition, cooperative supply chain perform better than non-cooperative supply  chain, both retailer and supplier improve the expected profit; the price compensation strategy is Pareto im- provement strategy;  2, with the increase of variance of coefficient of stochastic yield, both non-cooperation and cooperation  supply chain production plan decrease, so does the expected profit. It testifies the theory of Deo 2009, the  producer tends to reduce the produce plan, under the high risk of stochastic yield;  3, with the increase of variance of coefficient of stochastic yield, the price compensation of retailer is re- duced, which explains economic principle of the risk reduce the price;  4, in the non-cooperation supply chain, suppliers and expected profit of retailers is the 3-4 times larger than  supplier; by the application of price compensation strategy, the profit allocation is significantly balance and   expected profit difference between retailer and supplier reduce to about 2 times.  5. Summary  The coordination problems of agricultural product supply chain  with stochastic yield risk is studied. The  agricultural producing is high risk by the suffering natural disaster, and the low profit reduce the produce plan.  The market is shrink and the welfare of consumer is reduce. By introducing the price compensation strategy in  supply chain, the supplier is encouraged to raise the production plan, and the expected profit of whole supply  chain is raise. Mathematical models is established to prove the price compensation strategy of agricultural  products supply chain is Pareto improvement, increased both the the supplier and the retailer's expected profit  125 Guoping Nong and Sulin Pang /  IERI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  118 â€“ 125  and balance the profit allocation in supply chain. The study provides constructive suggestion to coordination  in the supply chain of agricultural products.

The agricultural producing is influenced by the natural conditions, and the yield is uncertain. While agricultural products is rigid demand goods, the fluctuations of yield cause greater volatility of prices. The two- echelon supply chain with one supplier and one retailor is studied, and the mathematical model is constructed. The model showed that prices compensation strategy is Pareto improvement for agricultural products supply chain with stochastic yield, and it also incentive agricultural products supplier to rise the production plan and balance the profit allocation of supply chain.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:keywords id="kwd0005" class="keyword" view="all"><ce:section-title id="sect0010">Keywords</ce:section-title><ce:keyword id="kw0005"><ce:text>Agricultural products supply chain</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0010"><ce:text>Prices compensation strategy</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0015"><ce:text>Stochastic yield</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0020"><ce:text>Pareto improvement</ce:text></ce:keyword></ce:keywords></head><tail view="all"><ce:bibliography id="bibl0005" view="all"><ce:section-title id="sect0020">References</ce:section-title><ce:bibliography-sec id="bibs0005" view="all"><ce:bib-reference id="bib0005"><ce:label>[1]</ce:label><ce:other-ref id="oref0005"><ce:textref>Kazaz B.
