The final contribution to the force is the van der Waals interaction. It includes the following contributions: (i) between the macroscopic Si tip of conical shape with the sphere of radius R at the end [27] and semi-infinite substrate; (ii) the dispersion forces between the atoms in the sample treated atomistically; and (iii) the interaction between the macroscopic part of the tip and the sample atoms. The first contribution is calculated analytically [27]. In fact, the macroscopic contribution to the van der Waals force is the same in each of the three systems described below, as it depends only on the tipâ€“surface separation, macroscopic sphere radius, cone-angle and Hamaker constant of the system [27]. All these quantities are identical in each system we look at, so that the van der Waals force acts as a background attractive force independent of the microscopic properties of the system [8]. The Hamaker constant needed for the calculation of the macroscopic van der Waals force is estimated to be 0.5eV [32].
