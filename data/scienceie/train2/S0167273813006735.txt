While impedance spectroscopy is a quite common method to investigate mixed conducting thin film electrodes, [6,10–12] oxygen tracer experiments are often performed on bulk samples [13–16]. Recently, several IEDP measurements of mixed conducting cathode materials were published with the oxide films being deposited on insulating substrates [17–19]. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge no study so far reported experiments with both techniques being applied on the same films at the same temperature. This contribution reports the results of a study applying EIS and IEDP to one and the same La0.6Sr0.4CoO3−δ (LSC) thin film in order to get complementary results on the resistive contributions of the oxygen reduction kinetics on such films. As electrical measurements require an oxygen ion conductor, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was used as substrate for LSC films with two different grain sizes. Quantitative material parameters are deduced from both types of experiments and comparison of the data allowed testing the appropriateness of analysis models.
