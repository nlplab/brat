In the brane system appearing in string/D-brane theory, the stableness is the most important requirement. We find some stable brane configurations in the SUSY bulk-boundary theory. We systematically solve the singular field equation using a general mathematical result about the free-wave solution in S1/Z2-space. The two scalars, the extra-component of the bulk-vector (A5) and the bulk-scalar (Φ), constitute the solutions. Their different roles are clarified. The importance of the “parallel” configuration is disclosed. The boundary condition (of A5) and the boundary matter fields are two important elements for making the localized configuration. Among all solutions, the solution (c1=−1, c2=−1) is expected to be the thin-wall limit of a kink solution. We present a bulk Higgs model corresponding to the non-singular solution. The model is expected to give a non-singular and stable brane solution in the SUSY bulk-boundary theory.
