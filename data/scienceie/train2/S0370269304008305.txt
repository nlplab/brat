Correlation of charm-quark–charm-antiquark in γp scattering are calculated in the kt-factorization approach. We apply different unintegrated gluon distributions (uGDF) used in the literature. The results of our calculations are compared with very recent experimental results from the FOCUS Collaboration. The CCFM uGDF developed recently by Kwieciński et al. gives a good description of the data. New observables are suggested for future studies. Predictions and perspectives for the HERA energies are presented.
