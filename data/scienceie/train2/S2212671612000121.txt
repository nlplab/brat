In this paper, three different approaches for implementing a quantum search algorithm by adiabatic evolution are shown. As expected, either one of them can provide a quadratic speed up as opposed to the classical search algorithm. This implies that adiabatic evolution based quantum computation gives more feasibilities than the quantum circuit model, although the equivalence between them has already been proven in the corresponding literature.
