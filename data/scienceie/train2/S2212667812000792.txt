A process-driven model is presented to build an instinctive and efficient higher educational administrative management system to overcome problems most universities facing. With this model, processes are identified explicitly and the routine of educational administration is broken into small tasks. Each task has designated role of executors. A process describes the activities and relationships among them. A prototype of higher educational administrative system is built with Bonita open solution. The demo shows that the process-driven higher educational administrative system helps end users understand processes they are involved and focus on what to do.
