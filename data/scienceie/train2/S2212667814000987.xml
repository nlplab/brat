Such systems are called Â«intelligentÂ» or  Â«smartÂ».  Globally speaking, Â«intelligentÂ» network is a complex of technical means which allows to change  characteristics of electrical grid immediately. On technological level aggregating of electrical grids, energy  consumers and producers in united automatized system takes part, this system being able to monitor and  control operating conditions of all its parts in real time [2].   Now in many developed countries active and successful introduction of intellectual energy supply  networks is held. As a result of using intelligent systems in the USA electrical grid peak loads have decreased,  electricity invoices have decreased by an average 10% , electricity cost having grown by 15%. In Europe  financing programmes of Â«intelligentÂ» networks in an amount of $750 bln for next 30 years is provided.  Nowadays the most active and widespread development and distribution of technology SmartGrid is seen in  Denmark [3, 4].  According to Â«Energy Strategy of Russia for the period up to 2030Â», one of top-priority directions of  scientific and technical progress in the field of electric energy industry is creating new-generation highly- integrated intelligent system-forming and distributing electrical grids in United energetic system of Russia.  2. Developing intelligent energy-saving electric power distribution system on industrial plant  According to stated above, MSTU Â«STANKINÂ» is carrying out researches on creating on an industrial  plant an intelligent energy-saving electric power distribution system designed to increase efficiency of using  electric power by means of making an automatized adaptive system for managing consumers with regard to  individual peculiarities of equipment used on the plant. Operational scheme of system under development is  shown on fig. 1.        Fig.1. Principal scheme of intelligent electric power distribution system on  industrial plant  The system under development includes:  119 E.M. Ugleva et al.  /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  117 â€“ 122   Î¾ local devices correcting parameters of supply voltage (ES-1);   Î¾ devices compensating arising reactive power (ARPCC);   Î¾ group of detectors mounted on every consumer (D);   Î¾ unique automatized management system which provides fast-response collecting information about grid  parameters in its every point  and forming control signals to be send to all elements of the grid for the  purpose of maximum decreasing of electric losses in the grid and increasing energy efficiency of the  equipment.  All mentioned components of the system have been developed by researches from MSTU Â«STANKINÂ».  As device correcting parameters of supply voltage serves energy-saving power supply ES-1 (fig.2)  developed and designed in MSTU Â«STANKINÂ».      Fig.2. Energy-saving power supply ES-1  Energy-saving power supply ES-1 converts parameters of supply line into those which are the most  optimal for technical process fulfilling on industrial equipment and outputs corrected supply voltage to motor  of the equipment, thus increasing its operational energy efficiency. This device has RF utility model patents  Nos.106058, 106388 [5].  For compensating arising reactive power Automatic Reactive Power Control and Compensation device  (ARPCC) is used. Advantage of reactive power compensation device is possibility of compensating reactive  power when abruptly variable loads arise on output shaft of electric motor (fig.3).                       (a)                                                                               (b)  Fig.3. Automatic Reactive Power Control and Compensation devices ARPCC: (a). general view of ARPCC; (b). ARPCC connected  to  lathe 16K20  Main characteristics of the device are the following:  120   E.M. Ugleva et al.  /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  117 â€“ 122   Î¾ control of power factor in automatic mode;   Î¾ possibility of increasing and decreasing settled power depending on needs;   Î¾ negligible losses of active power in limits of 0.30-0.45 kW for 100 kVAr;   Î¾ small mass of the device and its high mobility;   Î¾ ease of operation [6].  Devices described above are submitted to management system â€“ a complex of software tools which allow  to estimate data obtained from equipment, to make decisions and to send control signal to corresponding  device. Software complex is protected by software certificate of registration Nos.2011613118, 2011619073,  2011613118.   Fulfilled researches of experimental and pilot samples revealed decrease of 20-30% in industrial equipment  engines energy consumption (depending on type of technological process), equipment productivity staying at  invariably high levels. Characteristics of change in electric parameters (power factor, total power, active  power) of the grid and arising momentum depending on value of supply voltage amplitude are shown on fig.4.      (a)  (b)      (c)  Fig.4. Characteristics of change in electric parameters: (a) power factor; (b) total power; (c) active power   Using described system will allow:   Î¾ to decrease energy consumption of industrial technological equipment working in mode of variable loads  with saving and increasing equipment productivity  and quality of manufactured product;   Î¾ to decrease total energy consumption;   Î¾ to increase reliability and security;   Î¾ to increase carrying capacity of electric grid of a plant;   Î¾ to increase (probable) connected load;  121 E.M. Ugleva et al.  /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  117 â€“ 122   Î¾ to increase power lines and electrical equipment lifetime.  In this case economic efficiency is to result from decrease in energy rates of industrial plants which are to  introduce the intelligent energy-saving system under development and from increase in reliability and lifetime  of electrotechnical systems and complexes of the plant.  3. Developing intelligent system of power supply for consumers in DC grids  Activity of MSTU Â«STANKINÂ» is not limited to developing energy efficient devices powered by  alternating current. Since in some fields of industry it is advisably to switch internal grids from alternating  three-phase current to direct current, one of directions of the centre activity is investigating conditions of  reconstructing industrial plants aimed to let them use direct-current power.  Adapting industrial plants to direct-current power is associated with gradual replacing of asynchronous  three-phase motors as main electromechanical devices converting electric energy to mechanical one with  engines of new generation â€“ brushless DC electric motors which need direct-current power. Such motors have  higher technical characteristics, so they allow to design up-to-date industrial equipment with advanced  features. However, for a significantly long time machine tool stations and devices with three-phase  asynchronous motors will work side-by-side with new equipment. DC motors mounted to new equipment are  to get power from autonomous rectifiers the equipment contains. Modernization of old-fashioned equipment  fitted with three-phase asynchronous motors is being accomplished by fitting it with individual frequency  converters which allows to substantially improve operating characteristics of modernized machine tools.  Modern frequency converters are usually designed according to two- or even three-stage scheme which means  that each of them contains a DC link. Therefore, significant part of engines requires direct current for  operating either immediately or at the intermediate stage of converting. When sufficiently great part of total  consumed power falls within direct current it becomes economically reasonable to convert energy supply of  section/division/group of machine tools from three-phase AC to DC.   Converting energy supply to DC allows to avoid fitting autonomous rectifiers to each machine and to  significantly simplify frequency converters and make them cheaper by excluding segment of input  rectification which includes minimum 6 power rectifiers with cooling system and high-voltage storage  capacitors of high capacity.  Total power of rectifier needed to supply the equipment with AC is substantially smaller than sum of  powers of individual autonomous rectifiers and rectifying units but its energy efficiency is significantly  higher. Having one powerful rectifier, it is much easier to equip it with intelligent management system, by  means of using up-to-date schematic and algorithmic solutions increase its power factor, hold value cosÏ†  within given limits, decrease peak factor and provide symmetric loads on phases. Moreover, one may make  given unit of electricity distribution grid to actively compensate asymmetry and distortions of supply voltage  form and to increase cosÏ† of energy system in whole.   DC grids may contain autonomous or grouped storage capacitors being used to compensate starting  currents and overload momenta and to decrease mutual influence of consumers. DC grids are easier to  integrate into each other, algorithm of controlling such grids if they have several sources is much easier  because of eliminating synchronization and phasing problems. Recuperation of energy in DC grid does not  require complicated schemes of converters and synchronizers.   Systems of reserve power supply (e.g., autonomous diesel-generators) in DC grid may be combined with  additional reserving by means of secondary accumulator power-supply sources which allows to make electric  supply of vital objects or industries with continuous production cycle actually uninterruptible.  Controlling DC grids requires measuring devices, detectors, conversion and distribution devices (CDD)  and intelligent management system.  122   E.M. Ugleva et al.  /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  117 â€“ 122  To create proper conditions to reconstruct industrial plants so that they can use direct current, MSTU  Â«STANKINÂ» holds active works on developing devices described above. We develop conversion and  distribution units which are to provide converting three-phase alternating current  380/220 V 50 Hz into direct  current 220/440 V, up to 10 hierarchically organized devices in master and slave modes and in mode of  proportional load distribution having possibility of parallel operating using DC buses.   While operating as master, acceptable deviation of voltage should not exceed 5% of nominal value, while  operating as slave, load of master is to compose 100% and slaves are to give lacking power distributing it  between each other according to their priority. To provide cooperative load sharing between several CDDs  information about current intensities should be available to all in-parallel units, so encoded current intensities  come on communication and management bus connecting all the working CDDs.  Each CDD may be switched either to master mode or to slave mode by special key. Master unit provides  DC supply within power limits from zero to nominal power of given CDD. When total consummated power  exceeds nominal power of master unit, lacking power is given by slave unit. The system may contain any  amount of master and slave units, which includes the case when one of them equals zero. Units of one range  co-operates, i.e., power they bring to total load is being divided proportionally to their nominal powers.  In this case conversion and distribution units operate as part of information network using protocol  MODBUS and/or CANOPEN and can stay functioning and stable in the event of information network failure  by switching to autonomous mode with uniformly distributed load.  4. Conclusions  The devices and the system are recommended for using in production processes with continuous cycle of  working, where reliability is the most important characteristic. Also this system is recommended to use the  system processes with high variable loads. The modular design of the system allows to increase the total  capacity by adding additional modules. Using devices and systems under development will allow to  significantly decrease energy consumption, to increase electric grids reliability and life term and efficiency of  electricity use.

Recuperation of energy in DC grid does not  require complicated schemes of converters and synchronizers.   Systems of reserve power supply (e.g., autonomous diesel-generators) in DC grid may be combined with  additional reserving by means of secondary accumulator power-supply sources which allows to make electric  supply of vital objects or industries with continuous production c</xocs:rawtext><xocs:serial-item><article xmlns="http://www.elsevier.com/xml/ja/dtd" version="5.2" xml:lang="en" docsubtype="fla"><item-info><jid>IERI</jid><aid>435</aid><ce:pii>S2212-6678(14)00098-7</ce:pii><ce:doi>10.1016/j.ieri.2014.09.050</ce:doi><ce:copyright type="other" year="2014">The Authors</ce:copyright></item-info><head><ce:article-footnote><ce:label>☆</ce:label><ce:note-para id="npar0005" view="all">Selection and peer review under responsibility of Information Engineering Research Institute.</ce:note-para></ce:article-footnote><ce:title id="tit0005">Intelligent Power Consumption Management Systems</ce:title><ce:author-group id="aug0005"><ce:author id="aut0005"><ce:given-name>E.M.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Ugleva</ce:surname><ce:cross-ref id="crf0005" refid="cor0005"><ce:sup loc="post">⁎</ce:sup></ce:cross-ref><ce:e-address id="eadd0005" type="email">kotik-fox@yandex.ru</ce:e-address></ce:author><ce:author id="aut0010"><ce:given-name>K.A.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Zmieva</ce:surname></ce:author><ce:author id="aut0015"><ce:given-name>E.V.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Kuznetsova</ce:surname></ce:author><ce:affiliation id="aff0005"><ce:textfn>Research and Education Center «Energy Efficiency in Industry», Moscow State University of Technology «STANKIN», Moscow, Russian Federation, 127994</ce:textfn></ce:affiliation><ce:correspondence id="cor0005"><ce:label>⁎</ce:label><ce:text>Corresponding author.
