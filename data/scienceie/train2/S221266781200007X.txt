In this paper, the design of a varnish plant at Crocodile Matchet Limited, Tema, Ghana was considered and modification made to eliminate blooming and rusting of its product at the final processing plant when there is high moisture content in the atmosphere. The proposed design included pipelines or ductsand hot air receiving chambers for the Varnish Plant.Heat from the exhaust gas which would have otherwise, gone wasted, was utilised by redesigning the varnish plant and this yielded 6.74kW of heat energy which was transferred into the air chambers to aid the drying ofmatchets at the hardening plant. Consequently, the absorption of the moisture on the steel and the dryness of the product were improved. Further studies were done to ensure constant supply of hot air into the air chambers.
