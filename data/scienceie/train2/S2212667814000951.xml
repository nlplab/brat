Existence and Study of Design Semantics  Design is a product of human development at a certain stage. It is an integration of science and art, and an  active and intellectual activity in human life. â€œDesignâ€� itself is polysemous. From the general point of view,  all human activities with a certain purpose can be a design activity, which means design activities are socially  universal. The generalized design has close relations with peopleâ€™s living, including food, clothing, shelter                                                             * Corresponding author: Nie Hong.

The narrowed design mainly refers to the division of disciplines, such as Engineering Design,  Architectural Design, Industrial Design and more.  From the general point of view, design is neither pure art nor a part of scientific invention and technopole.  The connecting point of the two edges results in the linkage effect of design and the intersecting face of the  two edges results in the independent working area of design. Itâ€™s just like a weaving spider, just have to  connect all points including practicality, formality, spirituality and materiality. Alfred Tarski says in his  monograph â€œThe Concept of Truth in Formalized Languagesâ€� that â€œIt is to develop a essentially appropriate  and formally right definition of â€˜true sentenceâ€™ for a given language.â€� Design language includes scientific  language and art language. This feature displays a form of natural connection because these two languages  also contribute to the development of the feature. That means in the design language system scientific  language is expressed as â€œexplanationâ€� using a direct language to accurately express the subject, leading to a  clear meaning that is strictly accurate. This gives design language features such as being recognizable,  conceptual, logical, accurate and purposeful.  The complexity of design semantics is due to that it covers both artistical language and technical language  which are oppositely unified with each other. Art critics points out that the law of the unity of opposite of art  and technology is the ultimate of â€œbasic factorâ€�. â€œUltimateâ€� has two layers of meaning: the level of visual  perception of design, and to raise the design level to a language level.  The basis for the explanation of a design work is the design semantics, which should be a theory on how to  understanding the connotations of a design. One of the basic tasks of design semantics is to clear the  â€œdistanceâ€� between the designer and the recipient and set up dialogue relations between them. Gio Ponti once  said that a very important and interesting feature of human understanding is the heterogeneous isomorphism  of dialogue mode, understanding, metaphor and dialogue between the designer and the recipient. The study of  design semantics is to, based on this point, take all true understanding as dialogue and language and the  product from the creative and metaphoric application of design language.  As for design semantics, an important point for the study of cultural connotations of design is the  employment of symbols in cultural inheritance and accumulation. Design semantics stresses not only the  original meaning of design language itself and the cultural connotations revealed from the origin of the  meaning, but also the realistic and symbolic meaning of design language as cultural symbol in a certain  historical period. Ideographic symbols are cultural codes passed by people from generation to generation.  They have become an important part of design semantics because they explain the cultural connotations and  meanings of a design. Design semantics is not only the signal of expression of design emotions but also the  signal of expression of design reasonings. Design semantics also believes that design is of great social  significance. And we never consider design activities as individual behaviors because design from the very  beginning is a product of the society. So design semantics must be determined based on our recognitions from  our society. The meaning of symbols in a design mostly depend on the â€œsubjectiveâ€� will of the designer, but  when they are commonly recognized, exchanged and used by the public they become common and do not  carry a random meaning but a specific one, and finally become public criteria or social norms. The famous  American designer Jean gives an advanced and acceptable scope for the change of design language, which  covers form symbols established by usage and symbols with a publicly recognized semantic meaning. All  forms are normative to some extent. However, the information communicated by symbols should be more  than normal conditions to ensure the semantic information is more of semantic.       Design semantics notes that design forms have two different meanings, namely, denotative meaning and  symbolic meaning, which form denotative symbols and symbolic symbols. Denotative symbols are used to  describe â€œwhatâ€� the design form is to realize the cognitive functions of a design. Through denotative symbols  people can achieve their design targets, based on the judgments they made from past experiences. Symbolic  symbols are used to make people feel â€œhowâ€� about the design via a range of model factors that spur peopleâ€™s  96   Hong Nie and Shu Zhang /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  94 â€“ 101  thoughts. The meaning of symbolic symbols is generally implied rather than explicitly expressed. Imagination  is needed to reach its true reference. These symbols express both materialistic and aesthetic meanings. Design  semantics explains the design discipline from a new perspective. It analyzes the meaning of design and  defines the true meaning of design, and at the same time, it provides a methodology for the accurate  expression of the meaning of design activity. It sets up a channel of communication for Design, Work and  Recipient and specifies the connotation and denotation of design. It improves the design language system,  illustrates the relations between internal structures of design language, and analyzes the symbolic and logical  aspects of design, as to lay a foundation for the development of the design discipline.   2. Cultural Forms of Design Semantics  â€œThe cultural and art form feature of a nation and of a time happen to be the milestone of its historical  change, and the modeling style it displays is the inscription of the milestone.â€� [1]  Design is a â€œsocial-cultural  activityâ€�. â€œOn one hand, design is a creative activity similar to art; on the other, it is a rational activity  similar to rationalized science.â€� Clive Dilnot in his â€œTranscending Science and â€˜Anti-Scienceâ€™ in the  Philosophy of Design Methodâ€� take design as a social and cultural activity to study. Nowadays, design  researches are conducted in close connection with cultural researches. It has become a trend and be pushed to  the frontier of humanity studies. Design itself is a cultural behavior of humankind. It takes its appearance in a  physical form as well as a intangible cultural spirit. From the angle of culture, our understanding about the  material and spiritual meanings of the Eiffel Tower, the Pyramid, the Great Wall and others is also cultural.  The Eiffel Tower is totally a song of steel and technology that represent modern scientific civilization and  mechanical power, a new trend of thought on building during the Industrial Revolution, and also a turning- point of design taking the place of art. Since the last long century, it has been the symbol of Paris and even the  whole France. The Pyramid in Egypt changes the Nature with the power of Religion. Its incredibly huge body  reflects the cultural style of the Egypt at the stage dominated by religious designers. The Great Wall built by  Emperor Qin to resist foreign aggression has become the mental strength of the Chinese nation.  Ernst Cassirer tries to prove from the angle of humanistic philosophy that a man only becomes a real man  when involved in activities that create culture. He stresses that human nature always exists in creation, and in  hard work that constantly creates culture. Thatâ€™s how human nature is displayed. The true human nature lies  in the infinite creative activities. The cultures created by humans in the primal period are mainly physical,  such as unearthed production and living tools including stone and bone tools and potteries, etc.. On these  production and living tools there are also lines representing symbols. We can deduce to understand the  thoughts and cultures of the then human beings by analyzing the texture, shape, colors and decorations of  these tools. If we can generalize the cultural characteristic of humans as creativity, the creativity of primal  humans was manifested by making primary production and living tools in blind exploration. Then, how to let  human creativity go from blind to conscious, or say, how to turn blind creativity into conscious creativity?  Letâ€™s see from modern humans making and using tools. The premise of making a tool is design and the  premise of using a tool is the master of knowledge. And â€œdesignâ€� and â€œthe master of knowledgeâ€� here are a  demonstration of conscious creativity. Karl Marx said, when criticizing Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegelâ€™s  idealist views expressed in his â€œPhenomenology of Mindâ€�, that â€œin the â€˜Phenomenology of Mindâ€™,...the  individual firstly turns into â€˜consciousnessâ€™ and the world into â€˜objectâ€™, thus, diversities of life and history can  be summarized as relations between â€˜consciousnessâ€™ and â€˜objectâ€™.â€� [2]  Cassirerâ€™s trinity of â€œPhilosophy of Man,  Philosophy of Symbol, Philosophy of Cultureâ€� turns Man into Symbol and World into Culture, thus, diversities  of life and history be summarized as relations between Symbol and Culture. The cultural view of design is a  theory of symbolic function that takes the mode of thinking as the lead and deep emotions as the base. Design  form as the study of mode of thinking is the inevitable result of cultural view. In all activities that form a same  97 Hong Nie and Shu Zhang /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  94 â€“ 101  culture, although design takes its appearance as a new culture, it is influential to the man to rediscover himself  and the nature, and the relations between man and nature. It remains a revolution of social philosophical ideas.   â€œOf all human activities and cultural forms, we found a â€˜unity of multiple functionsâ€™. Art brings us a direct  unity of visual conceptions and the world science that opens â€˜the form of lifeâ€™ for us brings us a unity of  thoughts, revealing a world of laws and principles to us.â€� Design integrates multiple cultural activities to  arouse manâ€™s recognition of the power of science and art and the influence produced by them, so that the man  can rediscover the truth discovered by ancient philosophers, namely, the philosophy of â€œNature and Man in  Oneâ€�. The cultural view of this philosophical idea also influences design, especially space environment design.  3. Artistic Conception of Design Semantics and Space Environment  Artistic conception is a state of design art language. This artistic state is fused by subjective ideas and  emotions and objective scenes and environments. The basic constitution of artistic conception lies in the  fusion of scenes and emotions. It covers two aspects, namely, the objective reflection of objects and images in  our lives and the subjective emotions and ideas of the designer. These two aspects are organically unified and  fused into artistic conceptions. This is the first layer of meaning. And the second layer of meaning is that  although artistic conception is fused by scenes and emotions, only the image out of artistic images caused by  scenes and emotions can be called artistic conception. Ancient Chinese literature and art theorists referred this  feature as â€œenvironment comes from outside of imageâ€� and â€œimage out of images, scene out of scenesâ€�.  Artistic images fused by emotions and scenes form actual environments, which is finite and specific;  environments triggered by actual environments are call virtual environments, which is infinite. Artistic  conception is the dialectic and unification relations of image and environment, and actuality and virtuality. It  is the sum of the artistic image fused by scenes and emotions and the images of imagination it triggers. The  essence of artistic conception is the limitless artistic effect obtained from typification and combination of  virtuality and actuality.  Artistic conception is the unity of man and nature, man and things, scenes and emotions. Sceneries and  things in the nature arouses our emotions. Our emotions arises when we see the scenes. Emotions are  subjective. We usually say something is good to indicate our will or ideas, and to express our emotions and  feelings. Emotions and scenes, things and our ego, objectivity and subjectivity, all are unified into images. Liu  Yuxi once said â€œenvironment comes from outside of imageâ€�. Artistic conception is based on natural scenes  that are perceptual to man, but it must go beyond perceptual individual things and its essence must be  inevitably rational, just like what we usually say â€œperceivable but indescribableâ€�. [3]  More art theories study  â€œartistic conceptionâ€� as the spirit of Chinese art. They generally believe that artistic conception in art works  refers to the emotional appeal and the state expressed by and implied in the art work. In â€œWords and  Expressionsâ€�, the explanation is: â€œIdea, also known as Will.â€� Idea is kind of emotional thing from our feelings,  close to will or willingness. Therefore, no matter meaning â€œwillâ€� or â€œwillingnessâ€�, â€œideaâ€� itself is emotion- based. It comes from emotion and is an expression of emotion. This kind of idea does not belong to the scope  of rationality, namely, it is not our all-inclusive mind, nor a product of our mind. On the contrary, it is non- rational. It is the natural expression of the instinct of man, or the arousing or sublimation of our instinct. â€œIdea  is carefree a stateâ€�. â€œStateâ€� refers to the state of our spirit. It is the level of spirit or the spirit level. The  relation of Idea and State, from the general aesthetic point of view, refers to â€œemotion produces idea and idea  produces stateâ€�. Emotion is the basis and state with the help of idea or the trend of emotion sublimates the  emotion, or say, state is the fruit of emotion.  In China, the art for the use of garden materials in space environment stresses expressing ideas in both  actual and virtual scenes to create the artistic conception. The â€œTao Teh Kingâ€� describes that â€œwhen building a  house, a hole must be made for the installation of a door or a window so that people and air can come in and  98   Hong Nie and Shu Zhang /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  94 â€“ 101  out of the house and the house will be useful for people to live in.â€� â€œUsefulâ€� here refers to the space inside of  and under the roof of the house. Therefore, most houses have verandas, flower covers, folding screens,  antique shelves, green gauze cabinets, with (waterside) pavilions, towers, boats, window openings, artificial  hills, rocks, gully, waterfalls, brooks or creeks. That is to say, a garden only becomes a garden when it has  something crooked, a scenery only becomes a scenery when it has something virtual, and a house only  becomes a house when it has something transparent or insightful. Even when we piling rocks to make an  artificial hill, we must consider this style of art in order to recreate â€œnatural beautyâ€� in the garden and must  not pile all rocks without some apertures, crevices or openings. Quite on the contrary, making it â€œthin, uneven,  transparent and unrealâ€� is the essence. If there is no openings, there is no a high state of artistic conception. In  â€œLiterary Blank Theoryâ€�, the author made some comparisons between artistic world and aesthetic artistic  conception, pointing out that each and every artistic world is constructed with different constitutive elements  so a uniqueness can be obtained. Getting rid of the uncertain state of these constitutive elements, we get a  classic aesthetic artistic conception or a modern artistic world. The main tune of artistic world depends upon  our aesthetic style or standard. Classic aesthetic standard requires the artistic conception to be beautiful and  graceful. It pursues an artistic world in which the combination of tranquility and beauty, â€œnature and man in  oneâ€�, the unity of man and things, the integration of subjectivity and objectivity and the fusion of scenes and  images coexist, displaying a style that shows exquisite harmony, flexible tranquility, elegant taste, profound  culture and inner beauty. Instead, modern aesthetic standard is bringing in a new trend for aesthetic or beauty  appreciation by a variety of aesthetic main tunes and values. In the end, a fusion of horizon is achieved in the  process of artistic creation and reading or understanding, and between the development of the art form itself  and the aesthetic feeling.   Why space environment design becomes an important part of environment design is that it provides artistic  conceptions for the three-dimensional space of the space environment. The task of it is to connect all feelings  of people in the building and its surrounding environment and create a comfortable, safe, convenient and  beautiful material space environment based on peopleâ€™s characteristics of phycological behaviors. In the  design of space environment, it displays a combination of all aspects including natural and artificial, material  and spiritual, and time and space, as well as historical traditions and modern cultures. Here, we have to talk  about the classical Suzhou Gardens. The biggest watching point of Suzhou Gardens is its application of  borrowed and opposite sceneries in the design of these Chinese-style gardens, which are characterized by  â€œseeing different sceneries as you walkingâ€�. This is quite different from Western-style gardens and is  achieved through artful design by elaborately and meticulously arrange all sceneries and appreciation  locations. see Fig 1. Chines gardens try to perfectly display the space and structure of the external world in a  limited internal space. In the garden there are courts, pavilions and sheds, with winding verandas and paths.  Internal and external spaces connect to each other in a smooth and flowing manner. Through lattice windows  vast natural landscape comes into our eyes as a miniature. see Fig 2. Inscriptions of famous poets and  literators are everywhere, adding something literary to the exquisite garden. Clear streams flows passing  under our feet, reflecting the scenes of the garden, forming something that is both actual and virtual, which  takes the sightseer to a dreamy space from the real world. Beautiful sceneries are borrowed from external  environment and elaborately chosen and cut and located in the garden, or one scene reflecting another, to  make it even more unique and beautiful. By doing this, Suzhou Gardens, though with only a very limited  space, can provide an abundance of sceneries and landscapes with a higher level of taste which greatly  extends the space perception of the sightseer. Suzhou Garden provides sightseers with dainty, liberal,  exquisite, elaborate and quietly elegant and idealistic scenes. It stresses the harmony and unity of culture and  art. Its creative ideas, architectural techniques, humanistic contents and other aspects all are a display of  artistic conceptions. It is just like a quite small path that leads people from the realistic world to a artistic one.  â€œEnvironment is created by our mind. â€œAll physical environments are indeed virtual and only those  99 Hong Nie and Shu Zhang /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  94 â€“ 101  environments created by our mind are real and actual. [4] â€� â€œAs for an article, only it has an idea can it develop  an environment of story. Environment refers to what on our mind..Idea refer to what created by our mind.  And environment is also created by our idea. [5] â€� Therefore, artistic conception is an environment from our  artistic interest.                             Fig. 1. Chinese-style gardens                                                             Fig. 2. lattice windows 4. The Century Design Concept of â€œNature and Man in Oneâ€�  The though of Creation of â€œNature and Man in Oneâ€� deems that the forms of natural objects and artificial  objects are not opposite but complementary and interactive. Traditional Eastern wisdom stresses the ideas of  â€œNature and Man in Oneâ€� and â€œFollow the Natural World or The Tao Way Follows Natureâ€�, a non-separation  of subject from object. The â€œNatureâ€� in â€œThe Tao Way Follows Natureâ€� of the Taoists includes the natural  world as we understand. It is also at the highest level of state as â€œTaoâ€� is. Hence, â€œNatureâ€� is â€œTaoâ€�, the  ontology of the universe. At the same time, going from artificial objects to natural objects also means  returning to our original nature. Living in the world we must do things, which is what we call â€œacts of manâ€�.  As for â€œThe Tao Way Follows Natureâ€� and â€œNature and Man in Oneâ€�, we can see indeed the foresight of the  unity of Man and Nature. Nowadays, there are more and more natural forms being damaged or destroyed by  Man who have become more and more ruthless toward Nature in the world of artificial objects, and in the  process of development and exploitation, disobeying the Law of Nature, causing environment pollutions,  damaging ecological balance and, in the end, bringing harms to ourselves as Man.  Seeing from the angle of morphology, the forms of natural objects and artificial objects are a unity. For  example, human living environment and the nature are a unity. All cities and villages built by Man in the  world are built on a ecological environment of the Nature. Our comprehensive needs make us to design and  build our cities and villages by hill and water. Fundamentally, it reflects the complementary and interactive  relation between Man and Nature. All environment planning designers, when doing urban planning, do the  design from the wholistic view of â€œtwo in oneâ€�, namely, the unity and harmony of the ecological environment  and the buildings. Good designers would never do damage to the nature to build a building. Thatâ€™s why  Egyptians built their pyramids in the open land of the wild desert. On the land by the banks of the Nile were  huge monoliths, towering obelisks and magnificent pyramids. The Nile river was planned as a boundary to  divide the whole city into two parts. On the east bank are palaces and the city, called â€œValley of Kingsâ€�; on  the west bank are graves and temples, called â€œValley of Deathsâ€�. Inspired by sunrise and sunset, they created  a miracle in the human history of architecture. In China, the Great Wall was built along the mountains. It is a  perfect integration of natural form and artificial form. And the Gezhouba Water Conservancy Project at a  section of the Yangtze River is also a successful case of the interaction between Man and Nature by  employing modern technology and human wisdom.  â€œNature and Man in Oneâ€� stresses the coexistence or symbiosis of Man and Nature. The concept of  symbiosis takes Nature as a life entity. In the past, Man admitted the change of the Earth was a system of  100   Hong Nie and Shu Zhang /  IERI Procedia  9 ( 2014 )  94 â€“ 101  evolvement but they did not realize the symbiotic nature of the Nature. During the past 200 years, a sea  change has taken place on the Earth: forest coverage has reduced by 30%; thermometers are used to test if  people have catch a cold or a fever; El Nino are causing complications; scabies are growing on the banks of  rivers and by the sea; crusta are appearing on dry grassland and deserts. The crusta are interfering the  circulatory system of the Earth, which makes some rivers only have water flows on Fridays; those places with  scabies give off a large quantity of heat and poisonous gases; smock stacks or chimneys are intruding the  lymphatic system of Mother Earth and are removing the lubricant of it surface. Wastes generated are being  discharged into the air or water, which seriously influence atmosphereâ€™s capacity to release oxygen. The  damages to forests and plankton together cause more carbon dioxide and other gases in the air, doing harm to  the self-regulatory system of the biosphere. To concern the life on Earth is to concern the biosphere that has a  close symbiotic relationship with our living environment. Nature is an integral organic, not a simple addition  or combination of all constituent parts. The symbiotic view can release the weak and fragile biosphere from  the danger of collapse. The design philosophy, â€œNature and Man in Oneâ€�, not only refers to green design or  the functional design for the harmony between Man and Nature, but also the formation of a new control mode,  new â€œalternativeâ€� technologies and sciences under a new social, political, humane and aesthetic condition for  the final emancipation of both Man and Nature. The value-laden humanity design and planning conception  generated from against the background of the Industrial Age, namely, the transformation and control of the  Nature to meet human needs for existence and development, will be replaced by a design system with a  symbiosis view of â€œNature and Man in Oneâ€�. The meaning of this symbiosis view of â€œNature and Man in  Oneâ€� also provides a more macroscopic and creative design concept for our design. With the development of  science and technology, people are no longer satisfied with â€œdiscoveringâ€� things that have already been  existing in the Nature. They want to go farther beyond the Nature. And the symbiosis design philosophy of  â€œNature and Man in Oneâ€� will lead the Man back to a better state of living, a higher level of harmony between  Man and Nature.  5. Epilogue  Design semantics covers both artistical language and technical language, as well as social, cultural and  stylistic meanings. The design semantics form triggered needs of people for rational design in space  environment involve many areas including value philosophy, eco-environment research and pursuit of  humanity spirit and ideas. Design semantics takes the pursuit of a higher rational wisdom in human creation  activities as its orientation or final target. The pursuit of rational design is a process, a spiritual state, and also  a value orientation, as what we usually say that â€œIt is important not where you are but where you goâ€�.

Design semantics is the annotation of form and the reflection of its symbolic meaning, which means it is an explanation of the deposited human cultural spirit. Chinese art stresses Expression, Force and Qi. In China, people advocate “<ce:italic>to learn from nature</ce:italic>”, “<ce:italic>to look up to observe the sun, the moon and stars, and look down to observe the surroundings</ce:italic>”, and take “<ce:italic>Nature and Man in One</ce:italic>” as the highest state of spirit. Design semantics is expressed in space environment design through a symbiotic philosophical view that natural and artificial forms are complementary and interactive.
