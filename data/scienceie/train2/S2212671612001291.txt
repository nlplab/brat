In the paper we propose a conceptual methodology to control liquid state of Al-Si alloys in melting and holding sub-process of the pressure die-casting process. Given that, we determine the characteristic of the holding furnace based on weight percent (wt %) of the certain alloys and their elements. Subsequently the paper introduces an application of methodology of research for establishing characteristic of holding furnace. The application was realized under real conditions in foundry that uses horizontal cold chamber machine CLH 400.1. The chemical analysis was performed by spectrophotometer SPECTROLAB JR.CCD 2000. Finally the last part of the paper lists overall findings with possible future direction to extend this methodology in practice.
