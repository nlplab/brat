Another choice was to graft the fluorinated groups on the copolymers with functional groups. Casazza et al. [52] synthesized an acrylic terpolymer with pendent perfluoroether segments via grafting fluorinated groups into a poly(butyl methacrylate-co-hydroxyehtyl acrylate-co-ethyl acrylate) random copolymer through hexamethylene diisocyanate functionality. Malshe et al. [53,54] studied the coating properties of fluorinated acrylic copolymers based on MMA, BA, and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). They partially esterified hydroxyl functionality of HEMA with tetrafluoro propanoic acid and cured the polymer with butylated melamine formaldehyde resin. Such methods were suited for the synthesis of copolymers containing complicated fluorinated groups or difficult to be provided directly by living polymerization.
