Over subsequent years the structure had additional phases of repairs and CP installations. Due to the requirement to competitively tender each phase, a range of CP systems were installed between 1993 and 2013. The final phase was to replace the various power, control and monitoring systems that had been installed with a smaller number of more up to date units. As part of this process the historic operating performance of each system was employed to optimize the number and size of zones and the number of monitoring probes. In addition, a number of systems were installed but not energized until the final phase had been completed. This paper presents a review of the performance of the systems and the associated control equipment over the twenty year period.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:keywords id="kwd0005" class="keyword" view="all"><ce:section-title id="sect0015">Keywords</ce:section-title><ce:keyword id="kw0005"><ce:text>CP</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0010"><ce:text>Concrete Repair</ce:text></ce:keyword></ce:keywords></head><body view="all"><ce:sections><ce:section id="sec0005" role="introduction" view="all"><ce:label>1</ce:label><ce:section-title id="sect0010">Introduction</ce:section-title><ce:para id="par0005" view="all">The Silver Jubilee Bridge was designed by Mott Hay and Anderson (now Mott MacDonald) and opened in 1961 (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0030" refid="fig0005">Fig. 1</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig0005"/>).

The deck is reinforced concrete with a surfacing of mastic asphalt and rolled chippings. The approach viaducts to the bridge consist of reinforced concrete piers supporting four main beams, the ends of which were precast and the central spans cast in situ at the same time as the deck. The main beams were named east outer, east inner, west inner, west outer dependent on their location. The deck is waterproofed but has joints above every third pier.</ce:para><ce:para id="par0015" view="all">The original structure was designed to carry one lane of traffic in each direction, plus a shared centre lane for overtaking. In 1977, due to the ever increasing traffic demands, the bridge was widened to form two lanes running in both directions. This necessitated the widening of the approach viaducts by increasing the number of deck beams. Where necessary the additional beams were supported off the existing piers which were widened by encapsulating the stem and crosshead. The gap contained a fibreboard material to ensure separation between the new and the old piers. Typical details are shown in <ce:cross-ref id="crf0035" refid="fig0010">Fig. 2</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig0010"/>. The Runcorn Approach viaduct Piers were numbered R1âR15 from north to south. The Widnes approach viaduct piers were numbered N1âN6 from north to south.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec0010" view="all"><ce:label>2</ce:label><ce:section-title id="sect9015">Degradation of the structures</ce:section-title><ce:para id="par0020" view="all">In the UK it is common practice to waterproof bridge decks. It is often found that bridges will fail most frequently at or near the structural joints within the deck. It is at these points where movement or poor detailing can allow the ingress of water through to any structures beneath. This water is contaminated with deicing salts during the winter months, and the chlorides penetrate through the joints and run over the face of the substructure below. This leads to extensive corrosion and deterioration of the concrete.</ce:para><ce:para id="par0025" view="all">In the case of the Silver Jubilee Bridge Approach Viaducts this is exactly what had happened. Every pier that was located under a movement joint was exhibiting significant signs of degradation associated with chloride induced corrosion of the reinforcement. In addition to this, the beam ends and adjacent edges of the deck also suffered extensive chloride contamination and corrosion.</ce:para></ce:section><ce:section id="sec0015" view="all"><ce:label>3</ce:label><ce:section-title id="sect0020">Repair strategy</ce:section-title><ce:para id="par0030" view="all">It was established that the most cost effective repair strategy was to employ cathodic protection (CP). Due to the available funding it was necessary to install this over a number of phases. The repairs were prioritized to ensure the safety of the public. Holding repairs were also undertaken to remove any loose material to manage the risk of falling debris. It was felt that installing the control units in accessible areas would present a risk of vandalism and so the decision was made to install the control units at height and use remote monitoring and control for the CP. The original contract was developed with a recognition that each phase would be separately tendered, and may result in different control units being provided. It would be based on the works leaving a finish similar to the existing concrete piers, with a smooth face and appropriate features. The contract contained requirements based on the current state of the art to try and manage the risk of future compatibility. The requirements were as follows:<ce:list id="lis0005"><ce:list-item id="lsti0005"><ce:label>â¢</ce:label><ce:para id="par0035" view="all">Hayes compatible modems</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="lsti0010"><ce:label>â¢</ce:label><ce:para id="par0040" view="all">Lotus 123 and Wordperfect for data files</ce:para></ce:list-item><ce:list-item id="lsti0015"><ce:label>â¢</ce:label><ce:para id="par0045" view="all">2 No. 13A sockets in each cabinet.</ce:para></ce:list-item></ce:list></ce:para><ce:para id="par0050" view="all">The standard computer operating system at the time was MS DOS, with MS Windows 3.1 just being introduced.

Generally these systems were reliable, although typically it would take multiple attempts to achieve a successful connection. Downloading data began to fail on one of the systems and so data collection depended on collecting screen dumps (<ce:cross-ref id="crf0045" refid="fig0020">Fig. 4</ce:cross-ref><ce:float-anchor refid="fig0020"/>).</ce:para><ce:para id="par0095" view="all">One of the control units suffered a small fire that was identified at an annual monitoring visit.

This was attributed to the prolonged application of cathodic protection. A replacement control unit from Remco was procured and installed once finance was obtained. The opportunity was taken to reduce the number of separately controlled zones and probes being monitored. This proved successful, but required the specific use of a US Robotics external modem to ensure compatibility operating via a COM port.

It comprised a mesh and wet sprayed overlay, and also incorporated discrete anodes into the beam ends. Wet sprayed overly was selected as the pier was in close proximity to a school and it was considered this would reduce the airborne dust from the works. Previous overlays were dry sprayed. The control unit was provided by Dynamics and it downloaded data to an MS Access database via a phone line. The software was installed on a laptop running MS Windows 98, and it ran extremely slowly. Shortly after the second annual delamination survey it was noted that the overlay was becoming increasingly delaminated. Investigations identified a desiccated layer at the interface between the overlay and the parent concrete, but this did not clarify whether it was an application, curing or materials problem. This was rectified by wrapping the pier in a glass fibre scrim encapsulated in a polymer modified cementitious coating. The delaminating overlay did not affect the performance of the cathodic protection system.

Previous contracts had been procured with the contractor providing the detailed design. For this system the design was undertaken by Mott MacDonald. It was developed by looking at the systems installed previously and calculating what was actually required to achieve cathodic protection of the piers. This resulted in a significant reduction in the number of zones and monitoring probes. The varying amounts of steelwork in the beams had previously lead to up to 5 zones per beam, with multiple layers of mesh to achieve the design current density. On review of the data the operating current density was similar in all zones and so this was reduced to a single zone per beam. The encapsulation was susceptible to ASR and contained post tensioning and so it was decided to use a galvanic system based on Galvashield CC anodes from Fosroc. Our design did not include an option to allow depolarization of the galvanic system, but the contractor supplied one, such that the anodes could be remotely disconnected. The control unit was from Electrotech CP and operated via a broadband connection provided by the contractor.</ce:para><ce:para id="par0120" view="all">The system generally performed well but remote monitoring was significantly hampered by trying to arrange for broadband transfer from the contractor to the client. The provider selected by the contractor could not be used either by the client or Mott MacDonald. Transfer to a new provider was not a smooth process, and took over 12 months to resolve and there were compatibility issues with the control unit and the broadband provider. Ultimately Electrotech CP confirmed that monitoring could be performed without broadband and so this option was undertaken. However, in getting the broadband taken off the phone line, the entire phone line was removed in error and it took a further 6 months to re-arrange.</ce:para><ce:para id="par0125" view="all">The only other difficulty associated with this system was due to the relays installed to allow for depolarisation of the steel.

Each Duracenter had spare channels for power to allow for the failure of future components. A networked approach was employed with a single phone line on each side of the river, such that it was no longer necessary to provide multiple phone lines for adjacent systems. The monitoring was limited to 4 probes per zone, with the additional existing probes terminated in junction boxes to allow future use.

Generally the systems have worked, although the remote side of the majority have degraded with time in parallel with advancing technology. This has resulted in a requirement to physically visit site annually. A relatively small percentage of silver/silver chloride electrodes have failed, but sufficient redundancy was included in the original installation to circumvent this. Delaminations less than 1<ce:hsp sp="0.25"/>m<ce:sup loc="post">2</ce:sup> have not increased in size. One system that had an extensively delaminated overlay did have some remedial work applied, but the delamination did not affect the performance of the system. The actual level of intervention required rapidly reduces to a simple check that the systems are energized, and as such overly complex monitoring systems may not be required.</ce:para></ce:section></ce:sections></body><tail view="all"><ce:bibliography id="bibl0005" view="all"><ce:section-title id="sect0075">Reference</ce:section-title><ce:bibliography-sec id="bibs0005" view="all"><ce:bib-reference id="bib0005"><ce:label>Brueckner et al., 2011</ce:label><sb:reference id="sbref0005"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>R.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Brueckner</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>C.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Atkins</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>A.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Foster</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>R.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Merola</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>P.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Lambert</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Maintenance of transport structures using electro-chemical solutions</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:edited-book><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Proceedings of 4th concrete solutions</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:date>2011</sb:date><sb:publisher><sb:name>Taylor &amp; Francis Group</sb:name><sb:location>Dresden, Germany</sb:location></sb:publisher></sb:edited-book></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference></ce:bibliography-sec></ce:bibliography></tail></article></xocs:serial-item></xocs:doc>
