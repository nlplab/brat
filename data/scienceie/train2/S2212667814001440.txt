In this paper, we present a tele-operated mobile robot system for old age surveillance. The robot operates in autonomous mode in which the robots navigates in the environment and search for unusual situation of elderly people. If a patient is lying on the floor, the robot informs the user. The user switches the control mode from autonomous to haptic based user control. In the autonomous mode, the robot utilizes the visual sensor and landmarks to monitor the entire environment. The robot is equipped microphone, speaker and monitor making it possible to communicate with the user in remote place. In addition, the robot utilizes the vital sensors to check the patient's condition. The preliminary surveillance experiments show a good performance.
