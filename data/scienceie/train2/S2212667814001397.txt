In this paper, a regression analysis based method is proposed to calculate the Journal Influence Score. This Influence Score is used to measure the scientific influence of scholarly journals. Journal Influence Score is calculated by using various factors in a weighted manner. The Score is then compared with the SCImago Journal Score. The results show that the error is small between the existing and proposed methods, proving that the model is a feasible and effective way of calculating scientific impact of journals.
