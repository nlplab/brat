Virtual network attack and defense simulation platform is to construct an attack  and defense system with theoretical knowledge, reasonable structure, and suitable for the study of security  management for the above requirements. Network attack and defense simulation combat environment is  constructed to help security managers to raise the overall level of safety management, and enhance network  and information security [1-2] . Design of network attack and defense simulation platform is of great significance  to study the security of the network devices.   A design method of virtual network attack and defense simulation platform is constructed in this paper. The  composition and function of the platform is analyzed. The establishing and parsing of virtual network  topology is researched based on the Visio secondary development method, and the simulation is also  presented.   2. Overall design of virtual network attack and defense simulation platform   Virtual networks and devices are used to simulate the real ones in the network attack and defense  simulation platform. Its main functions contain generation of network topology, configuration of network  security device, implementation of network attacks, attack detection, attack records and statistics. The virtual  network device and topology are displayed in a graphical interface, and the functions of various devices are  simulated through some special properties and methods, which is propitious to carry through network attack  and defense simulation. The composition of network attack and defense simulation platform is shown in  Figure 1(a).   The main function of network attack server is the implementation of network attacks. Attack methods  selected from the attack database are used to attack the target device for testing.   Network defense simulation server is mainly composed of network data capture, network topology parsing,  virtual network device and virtual network database. During simulation, the virtual network topology is  established according to the actual situation, and the virtual network device should be configured according to  the actual parameters of each device. The data transmission in the virtual network is determined by the  network topology and device configuration. Each virtual device contains processes of data receiving, data  processing and logging. Data arriving at each device should be tested with the particular rules of the device.  The legitimate data will be transmitted properly while the illegitimate one will be discarded.   3. Creation and parsing of the virtual network topology  The creation of a virtual network topology is necessary for the construction of virtual network environment.  There are various methods for the creation of a virtual network topology. The secondary development of  drawing software technology is one of the most effective methods. It can simplify the development of the  graphics editing module, and the capabilities of devices can also be carried out in the programming software.  So Visio secondary development technology is used in the creation of virtual network topology.  3.1. Visio secondary development technology  Microsoft Office Visio 2003 ActiveX Control (Visio drawing control) can provide the full function for  Visio application as an embedded component through the Visio object model. Visio drawing control can be  driven by events or codes in the host application. In addition, the Visio drawing control provide chart  production environment in the context of the application user interface for users [3] .  The Visio drawing control components provide the function of the Visio application object model. It can  be embedded in the development of the host application using the Microsoft Visual Studio.NET, Microsoft  337 Wang Fangnian et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  335 â€“ 340  Office XP and Microsoft Office container (such as Microsoft Office Word 2010, Microsoft Internet Explorer  5.0 and other Microsoft ActiveX container). The control will display the shape of the drawing screen after  added to the host application. The Visio drawing control allows developers to extend custom applications and  solutions. Visio components can be driven by the user drawing operation or host application events and data  through providing programming capabilities, as well as control access to the full Visio object model. The  architecture of Visio drawing control in application [3]  is shown in Figure 1(b).   Diagram development with Visio is in an intuitive way. Both a topology diagram and a detailed technical  drawing are available through combination of the program predefined graphics, and graphics can be modified  or created to adapt to different business and requirements.

Creation of virtual network topology   Network topology edit provides environment for users to build a virtual net-work. Equipment selection,  connection, configuration and network testing can be simulated in this experimental environment.  The device model in the toolbox can be dragged to add a network device in the network attack and defense  platform. When a network device is added to the virtual network, a dialog box will be popped up asking to  enter the basic information of the device. The network device will be displayed in the network topology  drawing interface if the information is proper. The user can operate the related devices through the right  mouse button. For the router, the user can add some routing paths to the existing routing table; for the firewall,  the user can edit the firewall rules, and then add it to the firewall rule table.  When the required devices for network drilling are all added to the operating platform, network connection  between devices can be established. Visio secondary development technology is used for the generation of  virtual network topology, which can make use of the powerful drawing capabilities of Visio drawing. The  process of virtual network creation with Visio secondary development technology can be divided into the  following sections [4] :    Establishment of the mold  The virtual network device is called drawing cell, and the toolbox where the drawing cell is placed is called  the mold in Visio. Each drawing is a Shape, and each Shape has a corresponding Shape sheet. There are two  important tables in the Shape sheet: one is the User Defined Cells, the other is the Custom Properties.  Properties of simulation devices can be set through the two tables.  338   Wang Fangnian et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  335 â€“ 340  In the Establishment of the mold, the drawing cell symbol is mapped out in the drawing area firstly. Then,  the Shape Sheet spreadsheet is used to set properties for the drawing cell. Finally, the completed drawing cell  will be dragged to a new mold, which can be saved with a new name.   Control on the drawing cell with C#.NET  The control on the drawing cell with program contains two aspects: one is obtaining information of the  drawing cell; the other is writing information to the drawing cell and controlling the state. The function  shape.getCells() is used to obtain information of the drawing cell, and the specific values selected from Shape  sheet should be determined in accordance with the relevant parameters. For example, if there is a row called  obtained, the information should be written as follows:      The process of writing information to the drawing cell is similar to that of obtaining information, for  example:      The drawing cell and data can be separated through properties configuration. The data is stored in the  database, and can be associated with the drawing cell by a unique identification.   Definition of events  The corresponding menu should be popped up when the mouse right-click the virtual device components in  order to input and modify the data of the device. So the right-click events of the Visio drawing control should  be defined in the design of drawing cells. The codes of mouse handling event [5]  are shown in Figure 2(a).   When the drawing cell corresponding to each device is dragged to the drawing control from the mold and  connection between devices is constructed, the mapping of network topology is completed. After the  completion of network topology, rules of the network security devices should be set to lay the groundwork for  the attack and defense simulation. The rule setting mainly includes the router routing table and firewall  filtering rules. A virtual network topology is established after the configuration of the virtual network security  device.  When the drawing cell corresponding to each device is dragged to the drawing control from the mold and  connection between devices is constructed, the mapping of network topology is completed. After the  completion of network topology, rules of the network security devices should be set to lay the groundwork for  the attack and defense simulation. The rule setting mainly includes the router routing table and firewall  filtering rules. A virtual network topology is established after the configuration of the virtual network security  device.  3.3. Creation of virtual network topology  After the establishment of virtual network topology, all network devices show only a simple graphical  interface. The virtual network topology should be parsed to realize the simulation. The devices in the  graphical interface and its connection relationship should be obtained. In the platform, the virtual network  topology can be parsed by identifying the type of device and recording connection information of the cable.  The process of the virtual network topology parsing is shown in Figure 3(a).   Traversing all the virtual devices is essential for the parsing of virtual network topology. The type of each  device in the topology is determined firstly. If the device is network cable, the information of devices  339 Wang Fangnian et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  335 â€“ 340  connected to it is recorded to the database, including the device type and name. Otherwise, the basic device  information is directly recorded to the database, including device type, name, parameters and configuration.  Visio is a mature vector graphics system, and it is very convenient to obtain the topological relations  between the drawing cells. Network cable connecting different devices is used to determine the connection  between devices. The connection relationship of each device is written to the relevant attributes by Visio  during drawing graphics. The From Connects set of Connects properties of devices is used to obtain the  devices connected to current device, which is advantageous for the parsing of network topology [6] . The  function ParseNet() is used to parse the virtual network topology, the codes of which are shown in Figure2(b).  All the information has been recorded to the database after creation and parsing of the virtual network  topology. So all the simulation processes are transferred to the background simulation.         Figure 2: (a) The codes of mouse handling event, (b) Codes of ParseNet() function  4. Simulation results  The previous sections have conducted a comprehensive study for the architecture of network attack and  defense simulation platform. An attack and defensive simulation example is established to test the platform in  this section. The virtual network constructed in the platform is shown in Figure 3(b).  Select all the topology  Get the next device Estimate device type Cable Record information of  the connected device Connect to  other devices Parsing completes No Yes Yes No No Yes Drawing cell exists Yes Configured  device Record information of  the device All devices have  been parsed Warn Yes No Exit Re-parsing No    Figure 3: (a) Parsing of virtual network topology, (b) The main interface of network simulation platform   340   Wang Fangnian et al. /  AASRI Procedia  3 ( 2012 )  335 â€“ 340  Due to space limitations, the configuration of each network device is not shown. The statistics information  of each device can be obtained in the simulation. Figure 4(a) and Figure 4(b) show the statistics information  of Router3 and Firewall1, respectively.  It can be seen from the figure that whether the data of Router3 is transmitted depends on its routing table.  Data in line with the routing table will be transmitted to the next device, while the improper data is rejected  and logged. In the same way, data of Firewall1 compliant with the rules is transmitted, while the improper  data is discarded.  Various simulations are conducted for comprehensiveness test of the platform, and the system function is  analyzed through the statistics information of routers and firewalls. Simulation results show the virtual router  can transmit data according to the routing table, while the virtual firewall can filter data with the filtering rules,  which accord with the design objectives of the platform, and the desired purpose is achieved.      Figure 4: (a) Statistics of Router3, (b) Statistics of Firewall1   5. Conclusions  The composition and function of virtual network attack and defense simulation platform are analyzed in  this paper. The creation of virtual network topology is achieved through the Visio secondary development  technology and the parsing method of virtual network topology is also researched. Finally, the platform is  tested by network attack and defense instances.

Visio is a mature vector graphics system, and it is very convenient to obtain the topological relations  between the drawing cells. Network cable connecting different devices is used to determine the connection  between devices. The connection relationship of each device is written to the relevant attributes by Visio  during drawing graphics. The From Connects set of Connects properties of devices is used to obtain the  devices connected to current device, which is advantageous for the parsing of network topology [6] . The  function ParseNet() is used to parse the virtual network topology, the codes of which are shown in Figure2(b).  All the information has been recorded to the database after creation and parsing of the virtual network  topology. So all the simulation processes are transferred to the background simulation.         Figure 2: (a) The codes of mouse handling event, (b) Codes of ParseNet() function  4. Simulation results  The previous sections have conducted a comprehensive study for the architecture of network attack and  defense simulation platform. An attack and defensive simulation example is established to test the platform in  this section. The virtual network constructed in the platform is shown in Figure 3(b).

The statistics information  of each device can be obtained in the simulation. Figure 4(a) and Figure 4(b) show the statistics information  of Router3 and Firewall1, respectively.  It can be seen from the figure that whether the data of Router3 is transmitted depends on its routing table.  Data in line with the routing table will be transmitted to the next device, while the improper data is rejected  and logged. In the same way, data of Firewall1 compliant with the rules is transmitted, while the improper  data is discarded.  Various simulations are conducted for comprehensiveness test of the platform, and the system function is  analyzed through the statistics information of routers and firewalls. Simulation results show the virtual router  can transmit data according to the routing table, while the virtual firewall can filter data with the filtering rules,  which accord with the design objectives of the platform, and the desired purpose is achieved.      Figure 4: (a) Statistics of Router3, (b) Statistics of Firewall1   5. Conclusions  The composition and function of virtual network attack and defense simulation platform are analyzed in  this paper. The creation of virtual network topology is achieved through the Visio secondary development  technology and the parsing method of virtual network topology is also researched. Finally, the platform is  tested by network attack and defense instances.
