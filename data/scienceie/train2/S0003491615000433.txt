Nuclear theory devoted major efforts since 4 decades to describe thermalization in nuclear reactions, predominantly using semi-classical methods  [13,14,10], in line with similar problems in quantum liquids  [15,16]. There were attempts to develop improved molecular dynamics methods combining quantum features with a semi classical treatment of dynamical correlations  [17,18]. Still, no clear-cut quantum approach is readily available yet, in spite of numerous formal attempts [19,20,10]. The field of clusters and nano structures is far younger but fast developing in relation to the ongoing developments of lasers and imaging techniques. Semiclassical approaches were also considered in the field to include some dynamical corrections  [21,22] and could qualitatively describe dynamical processes. But such approaches are bound to simple metals with sufficiently delocalized wave functions, and thus smooth potentials justifying semiclassical approximations. The case of organic systems, in particular the much celebrated C60   [4,23], cannot be treated this way. Semi classical, and even classical approaches, can be used at very high excitations such as delivered by very intense laser pulses  [2]. In such cases the system is blown up and details of its quantum mechanical features do not matter anymore. But for less violent scenarios, quantum shell effects cannot be ignored.
