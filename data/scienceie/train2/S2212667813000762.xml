Therefore, on the basis of using high resolution remote sensing images to supervise the situation of the  newly increased construction land in some key zones, itâ€™s necessary to use wide covered and relatively cheap  middle resolution remote sensing images to supervise the macro situation of the new increased construction  land in the whole range. In this way, it could further complete the dynamic remote sensing supervision system  of new construction land increase in flatland zones of northwestern five provinces, meanwhile, the macro  supervision and micro supervision could compensate each other to offer just-in-time and comprehensive data  for macro decision making and land supervision administration in five provinces of the northwest[1-6].  Hence, itâ€™s necessary to conduct an experiment about the change detection of new increased construction  land with the middle resolution remote sensing images in some flat zones. Then, based on the experiment  results, the paper analyzes and discusses the ability of middle resolution remote sensing images in supervising  and discovering the change of newly increased construction land, in order to offer experience and reference to  the further work of change detection for newly increased construction land, especially for which is changed  from plow land.  2. Experimental Zones and Data Processing  2.1. Choosing of Experimental Zone  This research chose Yinchuan Plain as the experimental zone. Yinchuan Plain has a large area, so itâ€™s a  heavy work to use middle resolution images to supervise the whole zone. Considering the quality of existing  high resolution images, this experiment only chose some counties of Yinchuan Plain to conduct the dynamical  supervision. This experiment chose Xixia district, Jinfeng district, Xingqing district(the total area of three  districts is 9491 km 2 ), Helan county (1600 km 2 ) and Yongning city(1020 km 2 ). The total area is 12111 km 2 .  2.2. Data Preparation  (1)Middle resolution images  The collected middle resolution images of Yinchuan Plain were produced in 2007 and 2008. P6 data spatial  resolution was 23.5m, which has four channels, CBERS satellite multispectral data spatial resolution was 20m,  which has 5 channels, this test will use the remote sensing data for 20m scale of remote sensing data  representation.  (2)High resolution images  The collected high resolution images of Yinchuan Plain were produced in 2007 and 2008. This experiment  used these images to verify and evaluate the correctness of the newly increased construction land which was  extracted from middle resolution images.   2.3. Data Pre-processing  (1)Geomatic correction  Found out identifiable points from reference images, meanwhile considering the uniform distribution of  these points.  Found out corresponding points from image for corrective, and used the remote sensing processing  software to enter the coordinate values of these points one by one.  Conducted adjustment calculation with controlling points by quadratic polynomial fitting method,  resample pixels by double linear interpolation method, and deleted those points which had exceptional RMSE 77 Zhihong Liu et al. /  IERI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  75 â€“ 80  values, meanwhile ensured these deleted points did not influence the geometric correction results. The number  of controlling points were controlled between the theoretical minimum number (n+1)(n+2)/2 and the  recommended maximum number (n+1)(n+2)/2 to satisfy the requirement of geometric accuracy[7-10].  (2)Image registration  As images that used to identify and extract information of newly increased construction land were obtained  from different sensors and different time of two experimental zones, they were required to match well with  each other on spatial locations in the same zone. It meant image registration technologies were needed.  The CBERS Pan images, obtained in Dec 2007, were taken as the reference image, to register the 30 mâ€™s  middle resolution images in the experimental zone of Yinchuan Plain.  (3)Image enhancement  It was a complex process to obtain remote sensing images, and the quality of images were influenced by  atmosphere, optical system, sensor, electronic lines as well as the flight of the satellite etc., so it was necessary  to recover imagesâ€™ immanent texture and geometric features through the following method: first, using the  point spread function (PSF) of the imaging formation system to express the quality reduction; second, using  the Fourier transformation on PSF to obtain the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the imaging formation  system; after that, based on the inverse process of satellite imaging process, using the Wiener filtering to  recover and compensate the MTF; finally, the sharpness of images was enhanced. Meanwhile, in order to  sharpen useful information and amplify the difference of features, which would improve imagesâ€™ ability of  interpretation and analysis, the gray values of pixels were transformed to make the image features identified  and distinguished.  2.4. Extraction of New Increased Construction Land in Experimental Zones  (1)Establishment of new increased construction land interpretive marks  The establishments of new increased construction land interpretive marks were mainly on multiple spectral  images. Pattern spots of new increased construction land change of different data types were selected based on  the reference of high resolution images, at the same time described and categorized by their features:  Interpretive knowledge of the transformation from farm land to construction land  Interpretive knowledge of the transformation from unused land to construction land  (2)Extraction of new increased construction land pattern spots  Partition of grids  To avoid pattern spots of change were missed or repeated during the extracting process, the experimental  zones were partitioned into several equi-spaced grids, and each grid was a work unit. The size of the grid was  1 kmÃ—1 km for panchromatic high resolution images and 2 kmÃ—2 km for middle resolution images.  Extracting method of newly increased construction land pattern spots  Currently, the accuracy of auto classification by computer still cannot satisfy the work requirements, thus  this experiment used the human-computer interactive interpretation way to extract pattern spots of change.  Through the exchange between two periodsâ€™ multiple spectral images, the change information of the  spectrum, and interpret the pattern spots of newly increased construction land grid by grid on 20 m scale  middle resolution images were found. According to the color, size, shape, texture, structure, height, and shade  of images, the changed land was identified, the new increased construction land was drawn, and the changed  information was recorded.  In the same way, pattern spots of new increased construction land on the panchromatic images were  extracted, and the changed information was recorded for setting reference of the verification in the fieldwork.  78   Zhihong Liu et al. /  IERI Procedia  5 ( 2013 )  75 â€“ 80  3. Extracting and Analysis Results of New Increased Construction Land in Experimental Zones  (1)Supervising results of new increased construction land by 20 m scale middle resolution multiple spectral  images  In Yinchuan Plain experimental zone, 107 pattern spots of new increased construction land were extracted  through CBERS and P6 images data. The area in all was about 20607 acres. The spot distribution of new  increased construction land was shown in Fig. 1. In new construction land change spots, the largest pattern  spot was 2107 acres, and the smallest one was 6 acres. From the area distribution of view, areas of these  pattern spots were mainly between 10 acres to 50 acres and 100 acres to 500 acres.

Conclusions  In Yinchuan Plain experimental zone, 107 pattern spots of new increased construction land were extracted  through CBERS and P6 images data. the minimum spot average area of new construction land change  monitored by 20m scale remote sensing data based on CBERS and P6 multispectral data as the representative  is about 6 acres. Through the contrast analysis, the spatial resolution of CBERS and P6 multispectral data are  higher than BJ-1 multispectral data, so whether the image extraction accuracy or business meeting precision  are greatly improved, especially the ability identifying new construction land use change further strengthens,  shows in the recognition of the smallest pattern area reduces and the recognition accuracy increases.

Conclusions  In Yinchuan Plain experimental zone, 107 pattern spots of new increased construction land were extracted  through CBERS and P6 images data. the minimum spot average area of new construction land change  monitored by 20m scale remote sensing data based on CBERS and P6 multispectral data as the representative  is about 6 acres. Through the contrast analysis, the spatial resolution of CBERS and P6 multispectral data are  higher than BJ-1 multispectral data, so whether the image extraction accuracy or business meeting precision  are greatly improved, especially the ability identifying new construction land use change further strengthens,  shows in the recognition of the smallest pattern area reduces and the recognition accuracy increases.
