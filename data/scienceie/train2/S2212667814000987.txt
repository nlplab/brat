In this paper we consider problems of creating and introducing intelligent management systems as one of the most important mechanism of increasing energy efficiency in industry. Operating principles of intelligent electric power distribution systems developed in MSTU «STANKIN» for AC and DC grids on industrial plants are described. Essential devices composing the systems are considered, their technical characteristics are described. Experimental results are presented.In this paper we consider problems of creating and introducing intelligent management systems as one of the most important mechanism of increasing energy efficiency in industry.
