Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) can well solve the cross-cutting concerns. Because of the different features of aspect, AOP requires new techniques for testing. First, this paper proposes a model to test aspect-oriented software. In order to support the testing model of the first three steps, we propose the algorithm of selecting aspect relevant test cases. Then, we develop a new tool to implement the theoretical of automating select test case. Finally, a case of the Bank Account System is studied to illustrate our testing approach.
