In this paper, we present algorithms for automatic generation of logic reasoning questions. The algorithms are able to construct questions that are solvable with unique solutions. The algorithms employ AI techniques such as semantic networks to produce verbal questions. These algorithms are small in size and are able to replace traditional question databases. They are particularly suitable for implementation on the memory constrained mobile platforms. The algorithms can be applied to question generation for job interview, civil service exam, etc.
