In particular, in a competitive environment where the main resource is represented  by the information, a crucial role is played by technologies that facilitate their acquisition, their use and their  management.  2. Literature review  This paragraph presents an overview of the literature aimed at identifying both the most common  definitions of e-procurement (EP). The literature on this topic started to appear in the nineties. Van Weele  (1994) defines e-procurement as the use of Internet technology in the process of providing goods and services.  According to de Boer, Harink and Heijboer (2002), EP can be defined as using the Internet in the purchasing  process. In a similar way Presutti (2003) defines EP as a technology solution that facilitates corporate buying  using the Internet and Knudsen (2003) emphasizes the capability of electronic commerce to enhance the  procurement process.  In recent years, many authors have focused their studies on the evolution of the web-based systems in the  supply chain with a focus on growth, development and expected trends related to the implementation of a  platform for e-procurement. Leonard and Spring (2002) define EP as a model of strategic purchasing.More  specifically, Balocco and Rangone (2002) provide a description of the role of e-marketplaces and B2B  applications, focusing their discussion on the various models and tools for interaction based on the use of the  internet.   Previously, Monczkaand Trent (1998) had analyzed the functional value of the management of purchases  for the determination of the performance and competitive position of an organization in its business area, and  the reasons for the increase of interest in the purchasing area. In the same year, Ken Kenjale and Arnie  Phatak(2002) highlight how the Exchange B2b can create value chains that reduce costs for both the buyer and  for the supplier side, and how these tools align better the supply chain to customer needs.   In 2003, the observatory research on B2B of â€œPolitecnico di Milanoâ€� provides a set of tools that allow us to  qualitatively assess the levels reached in the management of transactions. Finally, in 2003, BertelÃ¨ and  Rangone provide the measure of the development of e-supply chain and e-collaboration, highlighting the  strengths, critical points for a correct and functional implementation and expected future trends (BertelÃ¨ and  Rangone, 2005).   3. E-procurement and E-supplychain  The adoption of technological solutions involves both organizational changes and reengineering of  processes. The use of B2B tools provides a new role to management, who can spend more attention to  strategic activities with greater added value. The traditional mode of acquisition is changed going from  centralized to decentralized and this leads to a fundamental change in the role of employees in purchasing.  Table 1 shows a summary of the evolution of the purchasing function following the adoption of tools for e- procurement. This change is proportional to the intensity with which company uses the electronic market. The  management will have to develop the rules that define the relationship between suppliers and customers. A  new corporate figure, will have to design tools for decision making that allows employees to set the criteria for  purchase. So, these tools provide support and supervision in the purchase phase and an integrated view of the  process.  E-Procurement is defined as "a technology solution that facilitates corporate buying using the Internet"  (Presutti, 2003). It 'a set of e-businesses and e-solutions that support the buying process. In this specific case,  10   Centobelli Piera et al. /  IERI Procedia  6 ( 2014 )  8 â€“ 14    the focus along the chain moves from downstream, and then from the last links in the chain, to upstream,  directly in contact with the supply network.  With e-procurement the entire procurement process is handled online, so the company decided to make the  purchases of various types, from raw materials to services, using B2B systems: these tools allow enterprises to  reduce the cost and time of the procurement process, improve inventory and stocks management and,  consequently, this is reflected in a decisive improvement in the management of all business processes. This is  a necessary solution for large companies because it makes easier and more effective the management of the  entire process of purchasing and supply network, and, on the other hand, for smaller companies that, in  adopting e-procurement solutions, can become part of a global business with many opportunities for growth.  The entire process of Procurement involves a series of processes of implementing as well as series of  evaluations on strategic choice. The entire process of e-Procurement is then divided into two phases:the phase  of e-sourcing and the phase of e-Supply Chain Management.  The e-supply chain is the series of processes involving a company and its main partners, managed in an  integrated manner with the potential of new technological solutions that allow the planning of processes and  objectives and the sharing of information relevant for the entire chain. In order to understand in detail the  characteristics of e-supply chain, it can be adopted an analytical model based on two variables interpretative:   Î¾ the application environment which includes the processes of e-supply chain execution and collaboration;   Î¾ the technological choices of the company.  4. The simulation model  The aim of thispaper was to study and analyze the behavior of the variables of a simulation model under  certain conditions. The model of e-collaboration, through implementation of e-procurement system, allows to  speed up the flow of supply, making the process of order release.  4.1. Setting used: stock and flow  The model developed simulates the behavior of a real manufacturing system that operates in a make-to- order environment. The purpose of the simulation is to analyze the behavior of the system following the  implementation of a model of e-collaboration, in terms of reduction of costs related to financial assets and  penalties. The production system described is composed of two chains of events: order picking in warehouse,  purchase orders.Purchase orders are characterized by an emission time that varies according to the number of  positions, of the amount and the monetary value of purchase orders. After the order release and the  subsequent shipment, the materials are in stock to be picked up.  In order to reduce the costs of inventory management is necessary that the materials are available from  stock in time for the date of picking. Generally pick orders depend on the configuration of bills of materials  (change board) that in case of variation require the release of new purchase orders (purchase orders subject to  change board).In this context it is necessary to differentiate temporally the two chains of events in order to  avoid the two situations described below:   Î¾ materials are available from stock in advance of the date of picking (increase in the cost of storage);   Î¾ materials are not available for picking (increase in the cost of penalties).  In the modeling process were analyzed two alternative approaches:  1. Model-based correlation of time series containing: number of orders released each year, number of late  orders each year, average delay.  2. Model based on aleatory variables limited superiorly and inferiorly.  11 Centobelli Piera et al. /  IERI Procedia  6 ( 2014 )  8 â€“ 14    It was decided to investigate the second approach, which allows to simulate the variability of the  phenomenon of release orders as shown in Fig. 1.

Level    The cost evaluation is carried out by analyzing the level of stock of the warehouse modified at each time  step from an input and an output flow.  4.2. Structure  In this context, particular attention was given to the variables that influence the flow of input and output  from the warehouse in order to identify any blinding costs related to the implementation of e-collaboration  model. We assumed threesimulation scenarios: without e-collaboration, with e-collaboration and chains of  events (purchase order, picking order) not phased and with the model of e-collaboration and chains of events  (purchase order, picking order) phased. Furthermore, it has been referenced documents of single-position  purchasing, characterized by a fixed economic value described by a step function.  The simulation scenarios are characterized by an observation period of one year and a timestep of one day,  and they are influenced by the following random variables: variability time of order release, variability  shipping time, variability time of picking and variability modification change board. The phenomenon of  change board is simulated by a logical condition with reference to the aleatory variable named "Change  Board"; in particular, the system initializes the release of a new document of purchase in case that variable  takes on a value less than 0.1, exposing the stock to higher inventories. The costs analyzed are of two types:   Î¾ Cost penalties: a percentage of the value of the supply valued for each time step;   Î¾ Cost of inventory: function of average stock level and standard cost of maintenance.  5. Simulation results  The three scenarios have revealed in quantitative terms the benefits associated with the implementation of  a model of e-collaboration. Comparing the first two scenarios, they show a decrease in penalties to customers  and at the same time an increase in financial assets that allow firms to avoid the occurrence of subsequent  penalties against a rapid change in demand. The increased speed of the process, achieved by reducing  activities not value added, allows to make the system more responsive to exogenous changes.The Fig. 3a  shown below represents the trend of the warehouses in the first two scenarios, Fig. 2b compare the e- collaboration scenarios with and without release time update.

Conclusions and future developments   The study presented has allowed us to analyze the growing interest that companies turn to web-based tools  to support the supply chain. The analysis shows that the recent success of the models of e-collaboration allows  various stakeholders to be more involved in the process of value creation:   Î¾ Suppliers: Collaboration between the company and its suppliers for process improvement (planning,  purchasing, logistics and administration) and an integrated approach to engineering design (exchange  technical documentation);   Î¾ Employees: Managing a centralized access point (portal), synthetic vision of the operations to be carried  out thanks to a simple and fast access to information (push logic);   Î¾ Other Stakeholders: Availability of indicators for measuring the performance of suppliers (eg,  management);   Î¾ Customers: Increase level of service received and the quality of the final product.  The strength of this solution consists in the possibility to integrate the supply chain starting from the  selection process of suppliers up to the billing process. The idea is to support the entire Supplier Lifecycle  integrating the business function of purchasing, logistics, quality and administration in order to be more  competitive on the market.The simulation model has allowed to detect in quantitative terms the savings  achievable with the adoption of a model and-collaboration. The model has shown how an enterprise can  derive further benefit in terms of cost modulating the flow of picking from the warehouse, as a function of the  higher speed achieved upstream of the process.  The work has analyzed some aspects of the management of a supply chain, covering warehouse  management under different boundary conditions, but the work of analysis can be extended to the rest of the  system.The future goal will be the implementation and validation of a model that allows to define the demand  on historical data, expanding the problem to the purchase documents subject to MRP run.

As it has been confirmed by numerous case studies, automation of procedures for the purchase through e-procurement technology enables companies to achieve a reduction in costs (average 8-12%) of total purchases. So web-based models are playing a critical role within companies, especially in the generation of value of supply chain. This article focuses on the role of e-procurement within a supply chain showing, through simulations, the advantages and difficulties of implementing a systematic use of the Internet and defining the basic structure of an e-supply chain.</ce:simple-para></ce:abstract-sec></ce:abstract><ce:keywords id="kwd0005" class="keyword" view="all"><ce:section-title id="sect0010">Keywords</ce:section-title><ce:keyword id="kw0005"><ce:text>E-procurement</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0010"><ce:text>E-supply chain</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0015"><ce:text>supply chain management</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0020"><ce:text>purchasing</ce:text></ce:keyword><ce:keyword id="kw0025"><ce:text>internet</ce:text></ce:keyword></ce:keywords></head><tail view="all"><ce:bibliography id="bibl0005" view="all"><ce:section-title id="sect0020">References</ce:section-title><ce:bibliography-sec id="bibs0005" view="all"><ce:bib-reference id="bib0005"><ce:label>[1]</ce:label><sb:reference id="sbref0005"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>A.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>VanWeele</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Purchasing Management:Analysis</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:book><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Planning and Practice</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:date>1994</sb:date><sb:publisher><sb:name>Chapman &amp; Hall</sb:name><sb:location>London, UK</sb:location></sb:publisher></sb:book></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib0010"><ce:label>[2]</ce:label><sb:reference id="sbref0010"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>L.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>de Boer</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>J.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Harink</ce:surname></sb:author><sb:author><ce:given-name>G.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Heijboer</ce:surname></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>A Conceptual Model for Assessing the Impact of Electronic Procurement</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>European Journal of Purchasing &amp; Supply Management</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>8</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2002</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>25</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>33</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib0015"><ce:label>[3]</ce:label><sb:reference id="sbref0015"><sb:contribution langtype="en"><sb:authors><sb:author><ce:given-name>W.D.</ce:given-name><ce:surname>Presutti</ce:surname><ce:suffix>Jr.</ce:suffix></sb:author></sb:authors><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Supply Management an E-Procurement: Creating Value Added in the Supply Chain</sb:maintitle></sb:title></sb:contribution><sb:host><sb:issue><sb:series><sb:title><sb:maintitle>Industrial Marketing Management</sb:maintitle></sb:title><sb:volume-nr>32</sb:volume-nr></sb:series><sb:date>2003</sb:date></sb:issue><sb:pages><sb:first-page>219</sb:first-page><sb:last-page>226</sb:last-page></sb:pages></sb:host></sb:reference></ce:bib-reference><ce:bib-reference id="bib0020"><ce:label>[4]</ce:label><ce:other-ref id="oref0020"><ce:textref>Knudsen D.
