Xylanases have potential applications in various fields. Some of the important applications are as fallows. Xylanases are used as bleaching agent in the pulp and paper industry. Mostly they are used to hydrolyzed the xylan component from wood which facilitate in removal of lignin (Viikari, Kantelinen, Buchert, & Puls, 1994). It also helps in brightening of the pulp to avoid the chlorine free bleaching operations (Paice, Jurasek, Ho, Bourbonnais, & Archibald, 1989). In bakeries the xylanase act on the gluten fraction of the dough and help in the even redistribution of the water content of the bread (Wong & Saddler, 1992). Xylanases also have potential application in animal feed industry. They are used for the hydrolysis of non-starchy polysaccharides such as arabinoxylan in monogastric diets (Walsh, Power, & Headon, 1993). Xylanases also play a key role in the maceration of vegetable matter (Beck & Scoot, 1974), protoplastation of plant cells, clarification of juices and wine (Biely, 1985) liquefaction of coffee mucilage for making liquid coffee, recovery of oil from subterranian mines, extraction of flavors and pigments, plant oils and starch (McCleary, 1986) and to improve the efficiency of agricultural silage production (Wong & Saddler, 1992).
