Three-dimensional digital subtraction angiographic (3D-DSA) images from diagnostic cerebral angiography were obtained at least one day prior to embolization in all patients. The raw data of 3D-DSA in a DICOM file were used for creating a 3D model of the target vessel segment. These data were converted to standard triangulation language (STL) surface data as an aggregation of fine triangular meshes using 3D visualization and measurement software (Amira version X, FEI, Burlington, MA, USA). An unstructured computational volumetric mesh was constructed from the triangulated surface. Smoothing and remeshing followed as next steps. The STL file was then transferred to a 3D printer (OBJET30 Pro; Stratasys Ltd., Eden Prairie, MN, USA). The resolution of the build layer was 0.028mm, and the 3D printed vessel model was produced using acrylic resin (Vero). Following immersion in water for a few hours, the surface of the 3D printed model was smoothed by manually removing spicule.
