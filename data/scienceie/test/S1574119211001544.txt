As future work on the protocol, we would promote two items. Firstly, the two mobility models that we have considered in this work propose possible way to capture social context in the way nodes move in the physical space, yet still potentially allowing nodes to explore the geographical regions considered in its entirety. Further insights to the performance potential could be given through the assessment of the protocol with other mobilities that can extend the physical region of movement as well as impose potential restrictions on the nodes mobility, for example by forcing similar nodes to move within specifically defined areas. Secondly, the different forwarding modes introduced in Section  3.3 express different levels of cooperation across the network. The push-community mode, for example, is a form of interest-community selfishness and assumes reciprocation in the nodes’ behaviour. The vulnerability (resp. resilience) of the protocol to different instances of node misbehaviours is a research item worth exploring.
