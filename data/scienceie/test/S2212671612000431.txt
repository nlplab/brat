In this paper, an implementation of a LBP (local binary pattern) based fast face recognition system on symbian platform is presented. First, face in picture taken from camera is detected using AdaBoost algorithm. Second, the pre-processing of the face is done, including eye location, geometric normalization, illumination normalization. During the face preprocessing, a rapid eye location method named ER (Eyeball Search) is proposed and implemented. Last, the improved LBP is adopted for recognition. Although the computational capability of the symbian platform is limited, the experimental results show good performance for recognition rate and time. in pressIn this paper, an implementation of a LBP (local binary pattern) based fast face recognition system on symbian platform is presented.
