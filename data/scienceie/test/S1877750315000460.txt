FabHemeLB is a Python tool which helps automate the construction and management of ensemble simulation workflows. FabHemeLB is an extended version of FabSim [27] configured to handle HemeLB operations. Both FabSim and FabHemeLB help to automate application deployment, execution and data analysis on remote resources. FabHemeLB can be used to compile and build HemeLB on any remote resource, to reuse machine-specific configurations, and to organize and curate simulation data. It can also submit HemeLB jobs to a remote resource specifying the number of cores and the wall clock time limit for completing a simulation. The tool is also able to monitor the queue status on remote resources, fetch results of completed jobs, and can conveniently combine functionalities into single one-line commands. In general, the FabHemeLB commands have the following structure:
