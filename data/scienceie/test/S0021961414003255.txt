Moreover, one observes segregation effects by the XRD analysis, which probably took place at high temperature, and were partially quenched to room temperature. The phase analysis showed up to three distinct phases, which should have hence a distinct measurable phase transition temperature, if they crystallise from the liquid on the surface. In the thermograms these effects are not observable as different solidification arrest or clear inflections. The proportion of new appearing phases is small and therefore the latent heat released by this new phase will be also small. The reflected light signal technique only showed one phase change during cooling. As well, the location of this segregation cannot be determined exactly in the molten pool or later in the re-solidified material. At the surface, where the temperature is measured, the material analysis by Raman spectroscopy has not shown signs of segregation, so that also the uncertainties in composition for the phase transition are taken from the uncertainties from the XRD analysis for the most abundant phase at each composition in re-solidified material.
