First results from RHIC on charged multiplicities, evolution of multiplicities with centrality, particle ratios and transverse momentum distributions in central and minimum bias collisions, are analyzed in a string model which includes hard collisions, collectivity in the initial state considered as string fusion, and rescattering of the produced secondaries. Multiplicities and their evolution with centrality are successfully reproduced. Transverse momentum distributions in the model show a larger pT-tail than experimental data, disagreement which grows with increasing centrality. Discrepancies with particle ratios appear and are examined comparing with previous features of the model at SPS.
