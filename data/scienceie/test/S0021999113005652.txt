It is interesting to quantify the effects of the Schmidt number and the chemical reaction rate on the bulk-mean concentration of B in water. The data could present important information on evaluating the environmental impacts of the degradation product of B, as well as acidification of water by the chemical reaction. Here, the bulk-mean concentration of B is defined by(24)CB⁎¯=∫01〈CB⁎〉(z⁎)dz⁎ Fig. 15 depicts the effect of the Schmidt and the chemical reaction rate on the bulk-mean concentration CB⁎¯. It is worth to mention here that the bulk-mean concentration of B reaches approximately 0.6 as the chemical reaction rate and the Schmidt number increase to infinite, and the concentration is smaller than the equilibrium concentration of A at the interface. This figure indicates that progress of the chemical reaction is somewhat interfered by turbulent mixing in water, and the efficiency of the chemical reaction is up to approximately 60%. The efficiency of the chemical reaction in water will be a function of the Reynolds number of the water flow, and the efficiency could increase as the Reynolds number increases. We need an extensive investigation on the efficiency of the aquarium chemical reaction in the near future to extend the results of this study further to establish practical modelling for the gas exchange between air and water.
