License Terms for BioNLP Shared Task 2011 Data


1. Copyright of abstracts

The abstracts contained in the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 (BioNLP-ST'11)
corpora are from PubMed(R), a database of the U.S. National Library of
Medicine (NLM).

NLM data are produced by a U.S. Government agency and include works of the
United States Government that are not protected by U.S. copyright law but
may be protected by non-US copyright law, as well as abstracts originating
from publications that may be protected by U.S. copyright law.

NLM assumes no responsibility or liability associated with use of
copyrighted material, including transmitting, reproducing, redistributing,
or making commercial use of the data. NLM does not provide legal advice
regarding copyright, fair use, or other aspects of intellectual property
rights. Persons contemplating any type of transmission or reproduction of
copyrighted material such as abstracts are advised to consult legal counsel.


2. Copyright of full texts

The full texts contained in the BioNLP-ST'11 corpora are from the
PMC Open Access Subset of PubMed Central (PMC), the U.S. National Institutes
of Health (NIH) free digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal
literature.

Articles in the PMC Open Access Subset are protected by copyright, but are
made available under a Creative Commons or similar license that generally
allows more liberal redistribution and reuse than a traditional copyrighted
work. Please refer to the license of each article for specific terms of use.


3. Copyright of annotations

The annotations attached to the documents are the results of
considerable effort by the BioNLP-ST'11 organizers. The copyrights of
annotations belong in their entirety to the organizers.


4. Distribution

Distribution of BioNLP-ST'11 abstracts drawn from PubMed is subject to
the PubMed(R) license terms as stated in Clause 1. Distribution of
BioNLP-ST'11 full texts is subject to the license terms applying to
each publication.

Under these conditions, the BioNLP-ST'11 data and annotation may be
distributed, with the understanding that the annotations are to be
used primarily for scholarly research in natural language processing
(NLP), information extraction (IE), and other relevant disciplines.


5. Reproduction

The annotations in the BioNLP-ST'11 corpora may be used to produce
other data, information systems or services only for bona fide
research of a non-profit nature. Users of those derived data, systems
or services must be provided a clear description of how the
data/system/service was derived, indicating the sources of data.


6. Commercial Use

Commercial or non-academic organisations wishing to make public use of
part or all of the corpus must obtain permission from the BioNLP-ST'11
organizers.
