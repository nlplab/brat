The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the particle shape on interacting particles flowing in a horizontal turbulent channel flow, for particles with a significant Stokes number. To achieve this, large eddy simulations (LES) of a horizontal turbulent channel flow laden with five different particle shapes, incorporating the drag, lift and toque model derived in Zastawny et al. (2012), are performed. The well-documented horizontal channel flow case described in Kussin and Sommerfeld (2002), who study spherical particles, is used as a reference case. The measurements in their work was done with phase Doppler anemometry (PDA), to measure the fluid and particle velocity simultaneously. The numerical framework applied in this paper has been previously validated for spherical particles in Mallouppas and van Wachem (2013). In that paper, it is shown that the comprehensive discrete element model (DEM) is more accurate in determining the behaviour of the particles in this horizontal gasâ€“solid channel flow that the hard-sphere model. Moreover, this paper showed that the fluid mechanics are accurately modelled using the LES framework. In the current paper, this framework is extended to account for non-spherical particles.
