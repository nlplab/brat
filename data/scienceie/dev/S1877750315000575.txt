There are some relevant studies on information dissemination in transportation systems using simulations. One category of studies look at how either local information (only about the neighbours) or global information (about the entire network) affects the global network performance. Our approach is different in the sense that we investigate the impact of information on the global network performance depending on the fraction of people that receive information. We analyse what is the effect of real time information dissemination and explain why this effect appears. Information is disseminated in real time and contains global details about how congested the roads are. This approach is important as it gives insights on the impact that massive use of real-time information can have on traffic. This can be useful for building more intelligent traffic control mechanisms where information is a steering tool.
