The four bounding PCM wastes, given in Table 1, were simulated using the most appropriate materials and geometries. “Mock up” PCM drums were assembled using the following components: PCM drums were simulated using mild steel paint cans and lids (Fenton Packaging Ltd.); PVC bags were replicated using identical PVC sheeting (Romar Workwear Ltd.); the metallic waste was simulated using commercial grade 18/8 stainless steel, aluminium and copper (Avus Metals & Plastics Ltd.), and lead shot (Aldrich); the inorganic waste was simulated using waste Pyrex labware, crushed masonry, concrete and window glass; CeO2 (from Acros Organics, >99.9%; dried 15h at 600°C) was used as a PuO2 surrogate. Commercially available ground, granulated blast-furnace slag “Calumite” was used as an additive [27]. The analysed chemical composition is given in Table 3. Calumite is a powdered material, with a typical particle size distribution between limits of ca. 40 to ca. 400μm.
