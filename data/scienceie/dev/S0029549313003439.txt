An essential part of nuclear reactor analysis is the prediction of the three-dimensional space-time kinetics of neutrons in a relatively large, finite, heterogeneous, three-dimensional reactor core. In a majority of safety analyses the prediction of reactor physics responses is performed using neutron diffusion theory applied to three-dimensional systems, with inputs usually derived from deterministic neutron transport solutions of two-dimensional lattice geometries. There has been increased activity related to uncertainty and sensitivity in reactor physics calculations, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development – Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD-NEA) has sponsored an ongoing benchmark entitled “Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling” (UAM) related to these efforts. The goal of this work is to offer a strategy for computing lattice sensitivities using the DRAGON lattice code and WIMS-D4 multi-group library. Results are presented with comparison to those from TSUNAMI, developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratories.
