# Simple text-based definitions of entity, relation and event types
# and event attributes for the GeneReg corpus.
#
# Note:
#
# In its original form of the GeneReg corpus is not consistent with the 
# BioNLP-ST annotation format, as it defines all events without trigger terms:
#
#   E1	NegativeRegulationOfGeneExpression: Cause:T120102 Theme:T13186
#
# Such annotations can be rewritten to compliant binary relations of the form
#
#   R1	NegativeRegulationOfGeneExpression Cause:T120102 Theme:T13186
# 
# by issuing the following commands:
#
#		$ cd GeneReg_V_1.0
#		$ perl -pi -e 's/^E(\d+[^:]+):/R$1/' *.a2
#
