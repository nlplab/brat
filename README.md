## Documentation ##

In an attempt to keep all user-facing documentation in one place, please visit
the [brat homepage][brat] which contains extensive documentation and examples
of how to use and configure brat. We apologise for only providing minimal
documentation along with the installation package but the risk of having
out-dated documentation delivered to our end-users is unacceptable.

If you find bugs in your brat installation or errors in the documentation,
please file an issue at our [issue tracker][brat_issues] and we will strive to
address it promptly.

## About brat ##

*brat* (brat rapid annotation tool) is based on the [stav][stav] visualiser
which was originally made in order to visualise
[BioNLP'11 Shared Task][bionlp_2011_st] data. brat aims to provide an
intuitive and fast way to create text-bound and relational annotations.
Recently, brat has been widely adopted in the community. It has been used to
create well-over 50,000 annotations by the [Genia group][genia] and several
other international research groups for a number of annotation projects.

[stav]:             https://github.com/nlplab/stav/
[bionlp_2011_st]:   http://2011.bionlp-st.org/
[genia]:            http://www.geniaproject.org/

brat aims to overcome short-comings of previous annotation tools such as:

* De-centralisation of configurations and data, causing synchronisation issues
* Annotations and related text not being visually adjacent
* Complexity of set-up for annotators
* Etc.

brat does this by:

* Data and configurations on a central web server (as Mark Twain said:
    "Put all your eggs in one basket, and then guard that basket!")
* Present text as it would appear to a reader and maintain annotations close
    to the text
* Zero set-up for annotators, leave configurations and server/data maintainence
    to other staff
